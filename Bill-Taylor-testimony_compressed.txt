THE CHAIRMAN:	All right.	Let's come to order.
2 Good morning, Ambassador Taylor.	And welcome to the
3 House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which along
4 with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees is
5 conducting this investigation as part of the official
6 i mpeach ment inquiry of the House of Representatives.	Today's
7 deposition is being conducted as part of the impeachment
8 inquiry.
9 In light of attempts by the State Department and the
10 administration to direct witnesses not to cooperate with the
II	inquiry, including efforts to limit witness testim ony , the
12 committee had no choice but to compel your appearance today.
13 We thank you for complying with the duly authorized
14 congressional subpoena.
15 Ambassador Taylor has served our country as a
16 distinguished di plomat and Ambassador.	Prior to returning to
17 Embassy Kyiv as Charge d'affaires in June 2019, Ambassador
18 Taylor served as executive vice president of the U.S.
19 Institute for Peace.
20 From 2006 to 2009, he served as U.S. Ambassador to
21 Ukraine and also held i mportant positions across the State
22 Department coordinating U.S. assistance efforts, in clud i ng to
23 Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.	He is also a
24 West Point grad, I believe, and a Vietnam veteran.	And we're
25 very grateful for your li fet i me of service.





6


Ambassador Taylor, we will ask you to introduce yourself
2 and your career experience more fully at the outset of
3 today's interview for the benefit of the record and all those
4 present.
5 Finally, to restate what I and others have emphasized in
6 other interviews, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal,
7 threat of reprisal, or attempt to retaliate against any U.S.
8 Government official for testifying before Congress, including
9 you or any of your colleagues.
10 It is disturbing that the State Department in
II	coordination with the White House has sought to prohibit
12 Department employees from cooperating with the inquiry and
13 have tri ed to limit what they can say.	This is unacceptable .
14 Thankfully, consummate professionals have demonstrated
15 remarkable courage in coming forward to testify and tell the
16 tru th.
17 Before I turn to committee counsel to begin the
18 interview, I invite Ranking Member Nunes to make any opening
19 remarks.
20 MR. NUNES:	I thank the gentleman.
21 Once again, we're here for what you're calling an
22 impeachment inquiry, but there are no rules governing an
23 impeachment inquiry.	Ther e's been no organization of this
24 impeachment inquiry, and so we're essentially operating under
25 a law less situation.

7


We sent a letter last week to the majority requesting a
2 number of things, but that is to be notified with documents
3 to at least all three committees under the structure.	Only
4 two of the three committees continue to get the documents for
5 some odd reason that's not explainable.
6 But in addition to that, now typical customs of this
7 committee in review of the transcripts are now being put
8 under lock so that no one has access to the transcripts.	And
9 I want to make a request to the court reporters to ensure
10 that no tapes disappear being that we have no access to these II	transcripts.
12 And, with that, I'll yield to Mr. Jordan.
13 MR. JORDAN:	I thank the gentleman for yielding.
14 I would just too echo the notice that we got yesterday
15 that the minority will not be given access to the transcript,
16 and even members of this committee or these three committees
17 can only view the transcript in the presence of someone from
18 the majority.	I don't know that I've seen that happen
19 before.	And just when I thought this process couldn't get
20 any more unfair, we find out how the transcripts are going to
21 be treated.
22 Ambassador, I want to thank you for bei ng here.	I also
23 want to thank you for your service to our country.
24 On September 24th, Speaker Pelosi unilaterally announced
25 that the House was beginning a so-called impeachment inquiry.

8


On October 2nd, Speaker Pelosi promised that the so-called
2 impeachment inquiry would, quote, treat the President with
3 fairness.	However, Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and the
4 Democrats are not living up to that basic promise.	Instead,
5 Democrats are conducting a rushed, closed-door, and
6 unprecedented impeachment inquiry.
7 Democrats are ignoring 45 years of bipartisan procedures
8 designed to provide elements of fundamental fairness and due
9 process in past impeachment inquiries:	The majority and
10 minority had coequal subpoena authori ty, the right to require
II	a committee vote on all subpoenas.	The Presi dent 's counsel
12 had a right to attend all depositions and hearings, including
13 those held in executive sessions.	The President's counsel
14 had the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to
15 propose witnesses.	The President's counsel had the right to
16 present evidence, object to the admission of evidence, and to
17 review all evidence presented, both favorable and
18 unfavorable.
19 Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schi ff's so-called
20 impeachment inquiry has none of these guarantees of
21 fundamental fairness and due process.	Most di sappoi nti ng,
22 Democrats are conducting this so-called impeachment inquiry
23 behind closed doors, and as the ranking member of the
24 Intelligence Committee just suggested, with no access given
25 to the -- no transcripts given to the minority party.

9


This seems to be nothing more than hiding this work from
2 the American people.	If Democrats intend to undo the will of
3 the American people just a year before the next election,
4 they should at least do so transparently and be willing to be
5 accountable for their acti ons.
6 With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Mccaul.
8 I would only say, because I don' t want to get into
9 extended debate, and we can discuss this without taking up
IO	the witness' time, that members of three committees have
II	access to the transcripts when the transcripts are completed
12 and they have had a chance to be finalized.
13 The one transcript that the minority was able to
14 download and print was leaked to the press promptly.	That's
15 a problem, and that is part of the reason we have to maintain
16 the security of the transcripts.
17 Finally, unlike the past impeachments where there was a
18 special counsel doing these proceedings before the grand
19 jury, there is no special counsel here because the Department
20 of Justice declined to even investigate the matter so we have
21 to do that work ourselves.
22 I'll now turn to committee counsel.
23 MR. NUNES:	Mr. Mccaul had an opening statement.
24 MR. MCCAUL:	I'll just be very brief.
25 To your point, the Foreign Affairs Committee has

10


jurisdiction over the majority of these witnesses.	We have a
2 SCIF at the Foreign Affairs Committee that can handle
3 classified information and electronically as well.	And I
4 would ask that you reconsider this new rule that you've
5 issued to allow us to have those documents in the Foreign
6 Affairs SCIF and to make it more accessible.
7 I agree with my colleagues, there's no House rule or
8 resolut i on authorizing this.	I talked to Ken Starr last
9 weekend.	There's a way to do this right, and I think we
10 should do it the same way we did the Clinton and Nixon
II	administration.	I think, in your words, you'll say that
12 [Disruption in hearing room.)
13 MR. MCCAUL:	The committee is not in order -- you wi ll
14 say that there's no special counsel.	So I guess my question
15 i s, are you the special counsel, slash. prosecutor and the
16 grand jury of this inquiry?
17 THE CHAIRMAN:	Are you finished with your opening
18 remarks?
19 MR. MCCAUL:	Yes.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Then let's proceed.
21 Mr. Goldman.
22 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.	This is a
23 deposition of a --
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	No further remarks will be entertained at
25 this time.	Mr. Goldman.

11


MR. GOLDMAN:	This is a deposition of Ambassador William
2 B. Taylor, Jr., conducted by the House Permanent Select
3 Committee on Intelligence pursuant to the impeachment inquiry
4 announced by the Speaker of the House on September 24th.
5 Ambassador Taylor --
6 MR. ROY:	There are members of this committee that are
7 unable to participate --
8 THE CHAIRMAN:	If the gentleman will suspend.
9 MR. ROY:	I'm going to have to be in the Subcommittee
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	The gentleman will
II	MR. ROY:	-- instead of being in here.	And then I've
12 got to schedule access -- to get access as a Member of
13 Congress to transcripts on a committee on which I sit when
14 rules have never been put forward?
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	If the gentleman will suspend.
16 MR. ROY:	What is this?
17 THE CHAIRMAN:	The gentleman is not recognized.	You can
18 take your comments outside, sir.
19 MR. ROY:	Take them outside to whom?	You're the judge
20 and jury sitting in here deciding who can see this clown
21 show.	When can we actually -- when can my colleagues who
22 aren't on this committee see the materials in question?
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	Sir, this witness has come all the way
24 from Ukraine.	If you could suspend so we can get to the
25 matter at hand.

12


MR. ROY:	Well, why won't you address the legitimate
2 concerns of thi s --
3 VOICES:	Out of order.
4 MR. ROY:	This whole hearing is out of order.	We've got
5 members of this committee
6 MRS. DEMINGS:	You really don't want to hear from this
7 witness, do you?
8 MR. ROY:	I would like the entire Congress to hear from
9 this witness.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	Members will suspend.	Members will
II	suspend.
12 Mr. Goldman. you're recognized.
13 MR. ROY:	What rules are we even operating under?
14 MR. GOLDMAN:	Ambassador Taylor, could you please state
15 your full name and spell your last name for the record?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Willi am Brochenbrough Tay lor, Jr.,
17 T-a-y-l-o-r.
18 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you.
19 Now, along with other proceedings in furtherance of the
20 inquiry, this deposition is part of a joint i nvesti gati on led
21 by the Intelligence Committee in coordination with the
22 Committees on Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform.
23 In the room today are majority staff and minority staff
24 from both the Foreign Affairs Committee and Oversight
25 Committee, as well as majority and minority staff from the




13


Intelligence Committee.	This is a staff-led deposition, but
2 members, of course, may ask questions during their allotted
3 time, as has been the case for every deposition and interview
4 since the inception of this investigation.
5 My name is Daniel Goldman.	I'm the director of
6 investigations for the HPSCI majority staff, and I want to
7 thank you very much for traveling from Ukraine to appear for
8 this deposition today.
9 I would like to do some brief introductions.	To my
10 right is Daniel Noble, senior investigative counsel for
II	HPSCI.	Mr. Noble and I will be conducting most of the
12 interview for the majority.
13 And I will now let my counterparts from the minority
14 staff introduce themselves who will be conducting the
15 interview for the minority.
16 MR. CASTOR:	Morning, Ambassador.	Steve Castor with the
17 Republican staff of the Oversight Committee.
18 MS. CASULLI:	Good morning.	Laura Casulli, deputy
19 general counsel, minority on the HPSCI.
20 MR. KOREN:	Michael Koren, House Oversight, Republican
21 committee staff.
22 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you.
23 This deposition will be conducted entirely at the
24 unclassified level.	However, the deposition is being
25 conducted in HPSCI's secure spaces and in the presence of

14


staff with appropri ate security clearances.	We also
2 understand that your attorneys have the appropriate security
3 clearances as well.	Is that correct?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct.
5 MR. GOLDMAN:	Okay.	It i s the commi ttee's expectati on,
6 however, tha t neither the questions asked of you nor the
7 answers provided by you wi ll require discussion of any
8 information that is currently or at any point could be
9 properl y classified under Executive Order 13526.
10 You are reminded that E.O. 13526 states that, quote, in
II	no case shall information be classified, continue to be
12 maintained as classified, or fail to be declass i fi ed,
13 unquote, for the purpose of concealing any vi ola ti ons of law
14 or preventing embarrassment of any person or entity.
15 If any of our questions can only be answered with
16 classi fi ed information, please inform us of that before you
17 answer the question and we wi ll adjust accordin gly.
18 Today's deposition is not being taken i n executive
19 session, but because of the sensitive and confidential nature
20 of some of the topics and material s that will be discussed
21 access to the transcript of the dep osi ti on will be limited to
22 the three commi ttees in attendance, which we have mentioned
23 before.
24 Unde r the House dep osi ti on rules, no Member of Congress
25 nor any staff member can discuss the substance of the




15


testimony you provide today with the public or the media.
2 You and your attorney will have an opportunity to review the
3 transcript if we can figure out an arrangement, given that
4 you are in post in Ukraine.
5 Before we begi n, I'd like to go over some of the ground
6 rules for this deposition.	We will be following the House
7 regulations for depositions, which we have previously
8 provided to your counsel.
9 The deposition will proceed as follows:	The majority
10 will be given 1 hour to ask questions, and then the minority II	will be gi ven 1 hour to ask questions.	Thereafter, we will
12 alternate back and forth between majority and minority in
13 45-minute rounds until questioning is complete.
14 We will take periodic breaks, but if you need a break at
15 any time, please do let us know.
16 Und er the House deposition rules, counsel for other
17 persons or government agencies may not attend.	You are
18 allowed to have an attorney present of your own during this
19 deposition, and I see that you have brought two.	Would
20 counsel please now state their appearance for the record?
21 MR. SMITH:	Jeffrey Smith, Arnold & Porter.
22 MR. BELLINGER:	John Bellin ger, Arnold & Porter.
23 MR. GOLDMAN :	Thank you.
24 There is a stenographer to your left tak i ng down
25 everything that is said in this deposition in order to make a

16


written record.	For that record to be clear, please wait
2 until each question is completed before you begin your
3 answer, and we will wait until you finish your response
4 before asking you the next question.
5 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal answers, such
6 as a shaking of your head, so it is important that you answer
7 each question with an audible, verbal answer.
8 We ask that you give complete replies to questions based
9 on your best recollection.	If a question is unclear or you
10 are uncertain in your response, please let us know.	And if
II	you do not know the answer to a question or cannot remember,
12 simply say so.
13 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a
14 privilege that is recognized by the committee.	If you refuse
15 to answer a question on the basis of privilege, staff may
16 either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the
17 chairman on any objection in person or by telephone during
18 the deposition at a time of the majority staff's choosing.
19 If the chair overrules any such objection, you are required
20 to answer the question.
21 And, finally, you are reminded that it is unlawful to
22 deliberately provide false information to Members of Congress
23 or staff.	It is imperative tha t you not only answer our
24 questions truthfully but that you give full and complete
25 answers to all questions asked of you.	Omissions may also be




17



considered as false statements.
2 As this deposition is under oath, Ambassador Taylor,
3 would you please stand and raise your right hand to be sworn.
4 Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to
5 give is the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
7 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you.	Let the record reflect that
8 the witness has been sworn.
9 And, with that, Ambassador Taylor, if you have any
10 opening remarks to make, now is the time.
11 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Chairman, members, I appreciate
12 the opportunity to appear here today to provide my
13 perspective on the events that are the subject of the
14 committees' inquiry.	My sole purpose is to provide the
15 committees with my views about the strategic importance of
16 Ukraine to the United States , as well as additional
17 information about the incidents in question.
18 I have dedicated my life to serving U.S. interests at
19 home and abroad, in both military and civilian roles.	My
20 background and experience are nonpartisan, and I have been
21 honored to serve under every administration, Republican and
22 Democratic, since 1985.
23 For 50 years, I've served the country starting as a
24 cadet at West Point; then as an infantry officer for 6 years,
25 including with the 101st Airborne Division in Vi etnam;. then

18


at the Department of Energy; then as a member of a Senate
2 staff; then at NATO; then with the State Department here and
3 abroad in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem, and Ukraine; and,
4 more recently, as executive vice president of the nonpartisan
5 United States Institute of Peace.
6 While I have served in many places and in different
7 capacities, I have a particular interest in and respect for
8 the importance of our country's relationship with Ukraine.
9 Our national security demands that this relationship remain
10 strong.
11 However, in August and September of this year, I became
12 increasingly concerned that our relationship wi th Ukraine was
13 being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal
14 channel of U.S. policymaking and by the withholding of vital
15 security assistance for domestic political reasons.	I hope
16 my remarks today will help the committees understand why I
17 believed that to be the case.
18 At the outset, I would like to convey several key
19 points:	Fi rst, Ukraine is a strategic partner of the United
20 States, important for the security of our country as well as
21 Europe; second, Ukraine i s, right at this moment, while we
22 sit in this room, and for the last 5 years, under armed
23 attack from Russia; thir d, the security assistance we provide
24 is crucial to Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression,
25 and, more importantly, sends a signal to Ukrainians and

19


Russians that we are Ukraine's reliable strategic partner;
2	and, finally, as the committees are now aware, I said on
3	September 9th, in a message to Ambassador Gordon Sondland,
4 that withholding security assistance in exchange for help
5 with a domestic political campaign in the United States would
6 be crazy.	I believed that then, and I still believe that.
7 Let me now provide the committees a chronology of the
8 events that led to my concern.	On May 28th of this year, I
9 met with Secretary Mike Pompeo who asked me to return to Kyiv
10 to lead our Embassy in Ukraine.	It was and is a critical
11 time in the U.S.- Ukrai ne relations.
12 Volodymyr Zelensky had just been elected Presi den t, and
13 Ukraine remained at war with Russia.	As the summer
14 approached, a new Ukrainian Government would be seated,
15 parliamentary elections were imminent, and the Ukrainian
16 political trajectory would be set for the next several years.
17 I had served as Ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009,
18 having been nominated by George W. Bush.	And in the
19 intervening 10 years, I have stayed engaged with Ukraine
20 visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a sma ll
21 Ukrainian, nongovernmental organization supporting good
22 governance and reform.
23 Across the responsibilities I have had in public
24 service, Ukraine is special for me, and Secretary Pompeo's
25 offer to return as chief of mission was compelling.	I am

20


convinced of the profound importance of Ukraine to the
2 security of the United States and Europe for two related
3 reasons:	First, if Ukraine succeeds in breaking free of
4 Russian i nfluence, it is possi ble for Europe to be whole,
5 free, democratic, and at peace.	In contrast, if Russia
6 dominates Uk rai ne, Russia will again become an empi re,
7 oppre ssi ng its people, and threatening its nei ghbors and the
8 rest of the world.
9 Second, with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the
10 conti nued aggression in Donbas, Russia v i olated countless
II	treaties, ignored all commitments, dismissed all the
12 principles that have kept the peace and contributed to
13 prosperity in Europe since World War II.	To restore
14 Ukraine's independence, Russia must leave Ukraine.	Thi s has
15 been and should conti nue to be a bi par ti san U.S. foreign
16 policy goal.
17 When I was serving outside of government during the
18 Obama admi ni strat i on and af ter the Russ i an invasion of
19 Uk rai ne i n 2014, I joined two other form er Ambassadors to
20 Ukraine in urging Obama admi ni strat i on officials at the State
21 Department, Defense Department, and othe r agencies to provide
22 lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine in order to dete r further
23 Russian aggression.	I also supported much stronger sanctions
24 against Russia.
25 All to say I cared about Ukraine's future and the

21


important U.S. interests there.	So, when Secretary Pompeo
2 asked me to go back to Kyiv, I wanted to say yes.	But it was
3 not an easy decision.	The former Ambassador, Masha
4 Yovanovitch, had been treated poorly, caught in a web of
5 political machinations, both in Kyiv and in Washington.	I
6 feared that those problems were still present.	When I talked
7 to her about accepting the offer, however, she urged me to go
8 for both policy reasons and for the morale of the Emba ssy.
9 Before answering the Secretary, I consulted both my wife
IO	and a respected former senior Republican official who has
II	been a mentor to me.	I wi ll tell you, my wife, in no
12 uncertain terms, strongly opposed the idea.	The mentor
13 counseled:	If your country asks you to do something, you do
14 it -- if you can be effective.
15 I could be effective only if the U.S. policy of strong
16 support for Ukraine, strong diplomatic support, along with
17 robust security, economic, and technical assistance were to
18 continue, and if I had the backing of the Secretary of State
19 to implement that policy.	I worried about what I had heard
20 concerning the role of Rudolph Giuliani, who had made several
21 high-profile statements about Ukraine and U.S. policy toward
22 the country.
23 So, during my meeting with Secretary Pompeo, on
24	May 28th, I made clear to him and the others present that if
25	U.S. policy toward Ukraine changed, he would not want me

22


posted there and I could not stay.	He assured me that the
2 policy of strong support for Ukraine would continue and that
3 he would support me in defending that policy.
4 With that understanding, I agreed to go back to Kyiv.
5 Because I was appointed by the Secretary but not reconfirmed
6 by the Senate, my official position was Charge d'affaires ad
7 interim.	I returned to Kyiv on June 17th carrying the
8 original copy of a letter President Trump signed the day
9 after I met with the Secretary.
10 In that letter, President Trump congratulated President
11 Zelensky on his election victory and invited him to a meeting
12 in the Oval Office.	I also brought with me a framed copy of
13 the Secretary's declaration that the United States would
14 never recognize the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea.
15 But once I arrived in Kyiv, I discovered a weird
16 combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately

17 alarming circumstances.	First, encouraging:
18 Zelensky was taking over Ukraine in a hurry.

President He had

19 appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled
20 anticorruption legislation.	He took quick executive action,
21 including opening Ukraine's High Anti-Corruption Court, which
22 was established under previous Presidential administration
23 but was never allowed to operate.
24 He called snap parliamentary elections	his party was
25 so new it had no representation in the Rada	and later won

23


an overwhelming mandate controlling 60 percent of the seats.
2 With his new parliamentary majority, President Zelensky
3 changed the Ukrainian constitution to remove absolute
4 immunity from Rada deputies, which had been the source of raw
5 corruption for decades.	There was much excitement in Kyiv
6 that this time things could be different.	A new Ukraine
7 might finally be breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past.
8 And, yet, I found a confusing and unusual arrangement
9 for making U.S. policy towards Ukraine.	There appeared to be
10 two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one II		regular and one highly irregular.
12 As the chief of mission, I had authority over the
13 regular, formal diplomatic processes, including the bulk of
14 the U.S. effort to support Ukraine against the Russian
15 invasion and to help it defeat corruption.
16 This regular channel of U.S. policymaking has
17 consistently had strong bipartisan support, both in Congress
18 and in all administrations since Ukraine's independence from
19 Russia in 1991.
20 At the same time, however, there was an irregular,
21 informal channel of U.S. policymaking with respect to
22 Ukraine, one which included then-Special Envoy Kurt Volker,
23 Ambassador Sondland, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and as I
24 subsequently learned, Mr. Giuliani.	I was clearly in the
25 regular channel, but I was also in the irregular one to the

24


extent that Ambassadors Volker and Sandland included me in
2 certain conversations.
3 Although this irregular channel was well connected in
4 Washington, it operated mostly outside of offi ci al State
5 Department channels.	This irregular channel began when
6 Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sandland, Secretary Perry, and
7 Senator Ron Johnson briefed President Trump on May 23rd upon
8 their- return from President Zelensky's inauguration.
9 The delegation returned to Washington enthusiastic about
10 the new Ukrainian President and urged President Trump to meet
II	with him early on to cement the U.S. Ukraine relationship.
12 But from what I understood, President Trump did not share
13 thei r enthusiasm for a meeting with Mr. Zelensky.
14 When I fir st arrived in Kyiv in June and Ju ly, the
15 actions of both the regular and irregular channels of foreign
16 policy served the same goal, a strong U.S.-Ukraine
17 partnership, but it became clear to me by August that the
18 channels had diverged in their objectives.	As this occurred,
19 I became increasingly concerned.
20 In late June, one of the goals of both channels was to
21 facilitate a visit by President Zelensky to the White House
22 for a meeting with President Trump, which President Trump had
23 promised in his congratulatory letter of May 29th.
24 Ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen.
25 During a conference call with Ambassador Volker, Acting

25



Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian
2 Affairs Phil Reeker, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland,
3 and Counselor of the U.S. Department of State Ulrich
4 Brechbuhl on June 18th, it was clear that a meeting between
5 the two Presidents was an agreed-on -- agreed-upon goal.
6 But during my subsequent communications with Ambassadors
7 Volker and Sondland, they relayed to me that the President
8 wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the meeting in
9 the Oval Offi ce.	It was not clear to me what this meant.
IO	On June 27th, Ambassador Sondland told me during a phone
II	conversation that President Zelensky needed to make clear to
12 President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not standing
13 in the way of i nvest i gati ons.
14 I sensed something odd when Ambassador Sondland told me
15 on June 28th that he did not wish to include most of the
16 regular interagency participants in a call planned with
17 President Zelensky later that day.
18 Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry,
19 and I were on this call dialing in from different locations.
20 However, Ambassador Sondland said that he wanted to make sure
21 no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added President
22 Zelensky to the call.
23 Also, before President Zelensky joined the call,
24 Ambassador Volker separately told the U.S. participants that
25 he, Ambassador Volker, planned to be explicit with President





26


Zelensky in a one-on-one meeting in Toronto on July 2nd about
2 what President Zelensky should do to get the meeting in the
3 White House.
4 Again, it was not clear to me on that call what this
5 meant, but Ambassador Volker noted that he would relay that
6 President Trump wanted to see rule of law, transparency, but
7 also, specifically, cooperation on investigations to get to
8 the bottom of things.
9 Once President Zelensky joined the call, the
10 conversation was focused on energy policy and the
11 Stanystsia-Luhanska bridge in Donbas.	President Zelensky
12 also said that he looked forward to the White House visit
13 President Trump had offered in his May 29th letter.
14 I reported on this call to Deputy Assistant Secretary of
15 State George Kent who had responsibility for Ukraine, and I
16 wrote a memo for the record, dated June 30th, that summarized
17 our conversation with President Zelensky.
18 By mid-July, it was becoming clear to me that the
19 meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on
20 investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian influence in
21 the 2016 elections.	It was also clear that this condition
22 was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to
23 understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.
24 On July 10, Ukrainian officials Alexander Danyliuk, the
25 Ukrainian National Security Advisor; Andrey Yermak, an

27



assistant to President Zelensky; and Secretary Perry;
2 then-National Security Advisor John Bolton; Ambassador
3 Volker; and Ambassador Sandland met at the White House.	I
4 did not participate in the meeting and did not receive a
5 readout of it until speaking with the National Security
6 Council's then-senior director for European and Russian
7 affairs, Fiona Hill, and the NSC's director for European
8 affairs, Alex Vindman, on July 19th.
9 On July 10, in Kyiv, I met with President Zelensky's
10 Chief of Staff, Andrei Bohdan, and then-foreign policy
II	adviser to the President and now Foreign Minister Vadym
12 Prystaiko, who told me that they had heard from Mr. Giuliani
13 that the phone call between the two Presidents was unlikely
14 to happen and that they were alarmed and disappointed.	I
15 relayed their concerns to Counselor Brechbuhl.
16 In a regular, NSC secure video conference call on
17	July 18th, I heard a staff person from the Office of
18 Management and Budget say that there was a hold on security
19 assistance to Ukraine but could not say why.	Toward the end
20 of this otherwise normal meeting, a voice on the call, the
21 person who was off screen, said that she was from 0MB and her
22 boss had instructed her not to approve any additional
23 spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further
24 notice.
25 I and the others on the call sat in astonishment.	The

28


Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and counted on not only
2 the training and weapons but also the assurance of U.S.
3 support.	All that the 0MB staff person said was that the
4 directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff
5 to 0MB.	In an instant, I realized that one of the key
6 pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.
7 The irregular policy channel was running contrary to the
8 goals of longstanding U.S. policy.	There followed a series
9 of NSC-led interagency meetings starting at the staff level
10 and qu i ckly reaching the level of Cabinet Secretaries.	At
II	every meeting, the unanimous conclusion was that the security
12 assistance should be reassumed, the hold lifted.
13 At one point the Defense Department was asked to perform
14 an analysis of the effectiveness of the assistance.	Within a
15 day, the Defense Department came back with the determ i nat i on
16 that the assistance was effective and should be resumed.
17 My understanding was that the Secretaries of Defense and
18 State, the CIA Director, and the National Security Advisor,
19 sought a joint meeting with the President to convince him to
20 release the hold, but such meeting was hard to schedule, and
21 the hold lasted well into September.
22 The next day on the phone, Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman
23 tri ed to reassure me that they were not aware of any official
24 change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine, OMB's announcement
25 notwithstanding.	They did confirm that the hold on security

29


assistance for Ukraine came from Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney
2 and that the Chief of Staff maintained a skeptical view of
3 Ukraine.
4 In the same July 19th phone call, they gave me an
5 account of the July 10th meeting with the Ukrainian officials
6 at the White House.	Specifically, they told me that
7 Ambassador Sondland had connected investigations with an Oval
8 Office meeting for President Zelensky, which so irritated
9 Ambassador Bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting, telling
10 Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman that they should have nothing to do
II	with domestic politics.
12 He also directed Dr. Hill to brief the lawyers.
13 Dr. Hill said that Ambassador Bolton referred to this as a
14 drug deal after the July 10th meeting.	Ambassador Bolton
15 opposed a call between President Zelensky and President Trump
16 out of concern that it would be a disaster.
17 Needless to say, the two Ukrainians in the meetings were
18 confused.	Ambassador Bolton, in the regular Ukraine policy
19 decisionmaking channel, wanted to talk about security,
20 energy, and reform.	Ambassador Sandland, a participant in
21 the irregular channel, wanted to talk about the connection
22 between a White House meeting and Ukrainian investigations.
23 Also, during our July 19th call, Dr. Hill informed me
24 that Ambassador Volker had met with Mr. Giuliani to discuss
25 Ukraine.	This caught me by surprise.	The next day, I asked

30


Ambassador Volker about that meeting but received no
2 response.	I began to sense that the two decisionmaking
3 channels, regular and i rregula r, were separate and at odds.
4 Later on July 19th and in the early morning of
5	July 20th, Kyiv time, I received text messages on a three-way
6 WhatsApp text conversation with Ambassadors Volker and
7 Sondland, a record of which I understand has already been
8 provided to the committees by Ambassador Volker.
9 Ambassador Sondland said that a call between President
10 Trump and President Zelensky would take place soon.
11 Ambassador Volker said that it was most im portant for
12 Zelensky to say that he will help i nvesti gati on and address
13 any specific personnel issues, if there are any.
14 Later on Ju ly 20th, I had a phone conversation with
15 Ambassador Sondland while he was on a tra i n from Pari s to
16 London.	Ambassador Sondland told me tha t he had recommended
17 to President Zelensky that he use the phrase, "I will leave
18 no stone unturned" with regard to i nves ti gati ons when
19 President Zelensky spoke with President Trump .
20 Also, on July 20th, I had a phone conversation with
21 Mr. Danyliuk, during which he conveyed to me that President
22 Zelensky did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S.
23 reelection campaign.	The next day, I texted both Ambassadors
24 Volker and Sondland about Presi dent Zelensky's concern.
25 On July 25th, Presi dent Trump and President Zelensky had




31


the long-awaited phone conversation.	Strangely, even though
2 I was chief of mission and was scheduled to meet with
3 President Zelensky along with Ambassador Volker the following
4 day, I received no readout of the call from the White House.
5 The Ukrainian Government issued a short, cryptic summary.
6 During a previously planned July 26th meeting, President
7 Zelensky told Ambassador Volker and me that he was happy with
8 the call, but he did not elaborate.	President Zelensky then
9 asked me about the face-to-face meeting in the Oval Office as
10 promised in the May 29th letter from President Trump.
II	After our meeting with President Zelensky, Ambassador
12 Volker and I trav eled to the frontline in northern Donbas to
13 receive a briefing from the commander of the forces on the
14 line of contact.	Arriving for the briefing in the military
15 headquarters, the commander thanked us for security
16 assistance, but I was aware that this assistance was on hold,
17 which made me uncomfortable .
18 Ambassador Volker and I could see the armed and hostile
19 Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge
20 across the line of contact.	Over 1 3 , 0 0 0 Ukrainians had been
21 killed in the war, one or two a week.	To this day, that
22 continues.	More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without
23 U.S. assistance.
24 Although I spent the morning of July 26th with President
25 Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials, the first summary of

32


the Trump-Zelensky call that I heard from anybody inside the
2 U.S. Government was during a phone call I had with Tim
3 Morrison, Dr. Hill's recent replacement at the NSC, on
4	July 28th.	Mr. Morrison told me that the call could have
5 been better and that President Trump had suggested that
6 President Zelensky or his staff meet with Mr. Giuliani and
7 Attorney General William Barr.	I did not see any official
8 readout of the call until it was publicly released on
9	September 25th.
10	On August 16,	I exchanged text messages with Ambassador
II	Volker, in which I learned that Mr. Yermak had asked that the
12 United States submit an official request for an investigation
13 into Burisma's alleged violations of Ukrainian law, if that's
14 what the United States desired.
15 A formal U.S. request to the Ukrainians to conduct an
16 i nvesti gati on based on violations of their own law struck me
17 as improper, and I recommended to Ambassador Volker that we
18 stay clear.	To find out the legal aspects of the question,
19 however, I gave him the name of a Deputy Assistant Attorney
20 General whom I thoug ht would be the proper point of contact
21 for seeking a U.S. referral for a foreign investigation.
22 By mid-August, because the security assistance had been
23 held for over a month for no reason that I could discern, I
24 was beginning to fear that the longstandi ng U.S. policy of
25 strong support for Ukraine was shifting.	I called Counselor

33


Brechbuhl to discuss this on August 21st.	He said that he
2 was not aware of a change of U.S. policy but would check on
3 the status of the security assistance.
4 My concern deepened the next day, on August 22nd, during
5 a phone call with Mr . Morrison.	I asked hi m if there had
6 been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to
7 which he responded:	It remains to be seen.
8 He also told me during this call that the President
9 doesn't want to provide any assistance at all.	That was
10 extremely troubling to me.	As I had told Secretary Pompeo in
11 May, i f the policy of strong suppor t for Ukraine were to
12 change, I would have to resi gn.	Based on my call with
13 Mr. Morrison, I was preparing to do so.
14 J ust days later, on August 27th, Ambassador Bolton
15 arrived in Kyiv and met with President Zelensky.	During
16 their meeting, security assistance was not discussed.
17 Amazingly, news of the hold on security assistance did not
18 leak out until August 29th.	I, on the other hand, was all
19 too aware of and still troubled by the hold.
20 Near the end of Ambassador Bolton's visit, I asked to
21 meet him privately, during which I expressed to him my
22 serious concern about the withholding of military assistance
23 to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were defending their country
24 from Russian aggression.
25 Ampassador Bolton recommended that I send a first-person

34


cable to Secretary Pompeo directly, relaying my concerns.	I
2 wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29th describing
3 the folly I saw in withholding military aid to Ukraine at a
4 ti me when hosti li ti es were sti ll active in the east and when
5 Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American
6 support for the Ukrainian Government.
7 I told the Secretary that I could not and would not
8 defend such a policy.	Although I received no specific
9 response, I heard that, soon ther eafter, the Secretary
10 carried the cable with him to a meeti ng at the White House
11 focused on security assistance for Ukraine.
12 The same day that I sent my cable to the Secretary,
13	August 29, Mr . Yermak contacted me and was very concerned,
14 aski ng about the wi thheld security assistance.	The hold that
15 the White House had placed on the assistance had just been
16 made public that day in a political story.	At that point, I
17 was embarrassed that I could not give him any explanation for
18 why it was withheld.
19 It had still not occurred to me that the hold on
20 security assistance could be related to the investigations.
21 That, however, would change.
22 On September 1st, just 3 days after my cable to
23 Secretary Pompeo, President Zelensky met Vice President Pence
24 at a bilateral me eti ng in Warsaw.	President Trump had
25 planned to travel to Warsaw but at the last minute had




35



canceled because of Hurricane Dorian.
2 Just hours before the Pence-Zelensky meeting, I
3 contacted Mr. Danyliuk to let him know that the delay of U.S.
4 security assistance was an all-or-nothing proposition, in the
5 sense that if the White House did not li ft the hold prior to
6 the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, the funds would
7 expire and Ukraine would receive nothing.
8 I was hopeful that, at the bilateral meeting or shortly
9 thereafter, the White House would lift the hold, but this was
10 not to be.	Indeed, I received a readout of the
II	Pence-Zelensky meeting over the phone for Mr. Morrison,
12 during which he told me President Zelensky had opened the
13 meeting by asking the Vice President about security
14 cooperation.
15 The Vice President did not respond substantively but
16 said he would talk to President Trump that night.	The Vice
17 President did say that President Trump wanted the Europeans
18 to do more to support Ukraine and that he wanted Ukrainians
19 to do more to fight corruption.
20 During this same phone call I had with Mr. Morrison, he
21 went on to describe a conversation Ambassador Sandland had
22 with Mr. Yermak at Warsaw.	Ambassador Sandland told
23 Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come
24 until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma
25 investigation.





36


I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the
2 Sondland-Yermak conversation.	This was the first time I had
3 heard that security assistance, not just the White House
4 meeting, was conditioned on the i nvest i gati ons.
5 Very concerned, on that same day, I sent Ambassador
6 Sondland a text message asking if we are now saying that
7 security assistance and a White House meeting are conditioned
8 on inv esti gat i ons. Ambassador Sondland responded asking me
9 to call him, which I did.
10 During tha t phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that
II	President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky
12 to state publicly tha t Ukraine will inv esti gat e Burisma and
13 alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S . election.
14 Ambassador Sondland also told me tha t he now recogni zed
15 that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian
16 officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with
17 President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of
18 investigations.	In fact, Ambassador Sondland said everything
19 was dependent on such an announcement, including security
20 assistance.	He said tha t President Trump wanted President
21 Zelensky in a box by making public statement about ordering
22 such investigations.
23 In the same September 1st call, I told Ambassador
24 Sondland that President Trump should have more respect for
25 another head of state and that what he described was not in

37


the interest of either President Trump or President Zelensky.
2 At that point, I asked Ambassador Sandland to push back on
3 President Trump's demand.	Ambassador Sandland pledged to
4 try.
5 We also discussed the possi bi li ty that Ukrainian
6 prosecutor general, rather than President Zelensky, would
7 make a statement about investigations, potentially in
8 coordination with Attorney General Barr's probe into the
9 investigation of interference in the 2016 elections.
10 The next day, September 2nd, Mr. Morrison called to
II	inform me that Mr. Danyliuk had asked him to come to his
12 hotel room in Warsaw where Mr. Danyliuk expressed concern
13 about the possible loss of U.S. support for Ukraine.
14 In particular, Mr. Morri son relayed to me that the
15 inability of any U.S. officials to respond to Ukraine's
16 explicit questions about security assistance was troubl i ng
17 them.	I was experiencing the same tensi on in my dealings
18 with the Ukrainians, including a meeting that I had had with
19 Defense Minister Andriy Zagordnyuk that day.
20 During my call with Mr. Morrison on September 2nd, I
21 also briefed Mr. Morrison on what Ambassador Sandland had
22 told me during our call the day prior.
23 On September 5th, I hosted Senators Johnson and Murphy
24 for a visit to Kyiv.	During their visit, we met with
25 President Zelensky.	His first question to the Senators was

38


about the withheld security assistance.	My recollecti on of
2 the meeting is that both Senators stressed that bipartisan
3 support for Ukraine in Washington was Ukraine's most
4 important strategic asset and that President Zelensky should
5 not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn into
6 U.S. domestic politics.
7 I had been making . and continue to make, this point to
8 all of my Ukrai ni an official contacts.	But the push to make
9 President Zelensky publicly commit to investigations of
10 Burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 elections showed
II	how the official fore i gn policy of the United States was
12 undercut by the irr egular efforts led by Mr. Giuliani.
13 Two days later, on September 7th, I had a conversation
14 with Mr. Morrison in which he described a phone conversation
15 earlier that day between Ambassadors Sandland and President
16 Trump.	Mr. Morrison said that he had a sinking feeling after
17 learning about this conversation from Ambassador Sandland.
18 According to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told
19 Ambassador Sandland that he was not asking for a quid pro
20 quo.	But President Trump did insist that President Zelensky
21 go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of
22 Biden and 2016 electi on interference, and that President
23 Zelensky should want to do this himself.	Mr. Morrison said
24 that he told Ambassador Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this
25 phone call between President Trump and Ambassador Sandland.




39


The following day, on September 8th, Ambassador Sondland
2 and I spoke on the phone.	He said he had talked to President
3 Trump, as I had suggested a week earlier, but that President
4 Trump was adamant that President Zelensky himself had to
5 clear things up and do it in public.	President Trump said it
6 was not a quid pro quo.
7 Ambassador Sondland said that he had talked to President
8 Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was
9 not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear
10 things up in public, we would be at a stalemate.	I
II	understood a stalemate to mean that Ukraine would not receive
12 the much-needed military assistance.	Ambassador Sondland
13 said that this conversation concluded with President Zelensky
14 agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.
15 After the call with Ambassador Sondland on
16	September 8th, I expressed my strong reservations in a text
17 message to Ambassador Sondland stating:	My nightmare is that
18 the Ukrainians give the interview and don't get the security
19 assi stance.	The Russians love it.	And I quit.
20 I was serious.
21 The next day I said to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker
22 that the message to the Ukrainians and Russians we send with
23 the decision on security assistance is key.	With the hold,
24 we have already shaken their faith in us.	I also said, I
25 think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help





40


with a political campaign.
2 Ambassador Sandland responded about 5 hours later that I
3 was incorrect about President Trump 's intentions.	The
4 President has been crystal clear:	No quid pro quos of any
5 kind.
6 Before these text messages, during our call on
7	September 8th, Ambassador Sandland tried to explain to me
8 that President Trump is a businessman.	When a businessman is
9 about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he
IO	sai d, the bus i nessman asks that person to pay up before
II	signing the check.
12 Ambassador Volker used the same terms several days later
13 when we were together at the Yalta European Strategy
14 Conference in Kyiv.	I argued to both that the explanation
15 made no sense.	The Ukrainians did not owe President Trump
16 anyth i ng, and holding up security assistance for domestic
17 political gain was crazy, as I had said in my text message to
18 Ambassador Sandland and Volker on September 9th.
19 Finally, I learned on September 11th that the hold had
20 been lifted and security assistance would be provided.	After
21 I learned that the security assistance was released on
22	September 11th, I personally conveyed the news to President
23 Zelensky and Foreign Minister Prystaiko.	And I again
24 reminded Mr. Yermak of the high strategic value of bipartisan
25 support for Ukraine and the importance of not getting




41


involved in other countries' elections.
2 My fear at the time was that, since Ambassador Sondland
3 had told me President Zelensky had already agreed to do a CNN
4 interview, President Zelensky would make a statement
5 regarding investigations that would have played into domestic
6 U.S. politics.	I sought to confirm through Mr. Danyliuk that
7 President Zelensky was not planning to give such an interview
8 to the media.
9 While Mr. Danyliuk initially confirmed that on
10	September 12th, I noticed during a meeting on the morning of
II	September 13th, at President Zelensky's office, that
12 Mr. Yermak looked uncom fortab le in response to the question.
13 Again, I asked Mr. Danyliuk to confirm that there would be no
14 CNN interview, which he did.
15 On September 25th, at the U.N. General Assembly session
16 in New York City, President Trump met President Zelensky
17 face-to-face.	He also released a transcript of the July 25th
18 call.	The United States gave the Ukrainians virtually no
19 notice of the release, and they were livid.
20 Although this was the first time I had seen the details
21 of President Trump's July 25th call with President Zelensky
22 in which he mentioned Vice President Biden, I had come to
23 understand well before then that "investigations" was a term
24 Ambassadors Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related
25 to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and

42


the Bidens.
2 Mr. Chairman, I recognize this is a rather lengthy
3 recitation of the events of the past few months, told from my
4 vantage point in Kyiv.	But I also recognize the importance
5 of the matters your committees are investigating, and I hope
6 that this chronology will provide some framework for your
7 questions.
8 I wish to conclude by returning to the points I made at
9 the outset:	Ukraine is important to the security of the
10 United States.	It has been attacked by Russ i a, which
II	continues its aggression against Ukraine.	If we believe in
12 the principle of sovereignty of nations on which our security
13 and the security of our friends and allies depends, we must
14 support Ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor.
15 Russian aggression cannot stand.
16 There are two Ukraine stories today, Mr. Chairman.	The
17 first is the one we are discussing this morning and that you
18 have been hearing for the past 2 weeks.	It's a rancorous
19 story about whistleblowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid
20 pro quos, cor rupt i on, interference in elections.	In thi s
21 story Ukraine is an object.
22 But there's another Ukraine story, a positive,
23 bipartisan one.	In this second story, Ukraine is the
24 subject.	This one is about young people in a young nation
25 struggling to break free of its past, hopeful their new




43



government will finally usher in a new Ukra i ne, proud of its
2 independence from Russia, eager to join Western institutions
3 and enjoy a more secure and prosperous li fe.
4 Thi s story describes a Nation developing an inclusive,
5 democrat i c nationalism, not unlike what we in America, in our
6 best moments, feel about our diverse country -- less
7 concerned about what language we speak; what religion, if
8 any, we practice; where our parents and grandparents came
9 from	more concerned about building a new country.
10 Because of the strategic importance of Ukraine and our II	effort to create a whole , free Europe, we, through Republican
12 and Democrat i c administrations over three decades, have
13 3	supported Ukraine.	Congress has been very generous over the
14 years with assistance funding, both civilian and military,
15 and political support.
16 With overwhelming bipartisan majorities, Congress has
17 supported Ukraine with harsh sanctions on Russia for invading
18 and occupying Ukraine.	We can be proud of that support and
19 that we have stood up to a dictator's aggression against a
20 democratic neighbor.
21 This second story, Mr. Chairman, is the one I would like
22 to leave you with today.	And I'm glad to answer your
23 questions.

THE CHAIRMAN:	Ambassador, thank you.	We're just trying
2 to process what you said.	Thank you for your detailed
3 opening statement.
4 I recognize Mr. Goldman now for an hour of questions by
5 the majority to be followed by an hour of questions from the
6 minority.
7 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
8 Q	Thank you, Ambassador Taylor.	Thank you for the
9 detailed opening statement.	We obviously just received it,
10 and we'll do our best not to be too repetitive.
II It is incredibly detailed, and I note that you mention
12 that you wrote a memo to file on June 30th and that you sent
13 a cable to Secretary Pompeo on August 27.	Can you tell us
14 whether there were any other documents that you relied upon
15 in putting together this opening statement today?
16 A	Yes.	Three sources, I guess.	One you are familiar
17 with are the texts of WhatsApp messages that Ambassador
18 Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and I exchanged.	There were
19 other WhatsApp messages that I exchanged with Ukrainian
20 officials and other American officials, all of which, like
21 Ambassador Volker's package, I have provided to the State
22 Department.	That's number one.
23 Number two, I've always kept careful notes, and I keep a
24 little notebook where I take notes on conversations, in
25 particular when I'm not in the office.	So, in meetings with

46


Ukrainian officials or when I'm out and I get a phone call
2 and I can -- I keep notes.
3 The third documents are handwritten notes that I take on
4 a small, li ttle spiral notebook in my office of phone calls
5 that take place in my office.	So those, I think, are the
6 three sources of information that you see here.	You will see
7 some quotes and those are quotes from either the WhatsApp
8 texts or from my notes.
9 Q	And have you provided all of those documents to the
IO	State Department?
11 A	I have.
12 Q	At their request.	Is that right?
13 A	At their request.	I thi nk in response to your
14 subpoena to the State Department, they did a document search
15 which came, of course, to Embassy Kyiv, applied to the State
16 Department.	We did a search of all of our documents,
17 i ncl uding the ones I just mentioned, and sent them into the
18 State Department.
19 Q	Okay.	And I assume that you are aware that, other
20 than the WhatsApp messages that Ambassador Volker provided to
21 the committees, the committees have not received any of these
22 documents from the State Department?
23 A	I assumed that, but I didn't know that until you

24 confirmed it.
25 Q	Okay.	But you remain in possession of your

47


personal documents?

2 A	I do.
3 Q	Okay.	Prior to your testimony here today, did you


4

20
21

22

23

24

25

have any discussions with anyone at the State Department about your testimony?
A	No.
      Q	Did you receive any instructions from the State Department about your testimony?
      A		Yes.	Let me be clear, I had no substantive conversations with anyone about testimony.	I have been in touch.	As soon as I got your invitation, I, as instructed, talked to our congressional liaison and in turn our legal office, which John Bellinger knows something about.	And they gave me instructions on how I was to proceed.	So I've had those conversations with them, with what we call Hand L. People in the room are probably familiar with both.
      Q	Right.	But you did not show this opening statement to anyone at the State Department?
A	That's correct.
      Q	And you did not receive any guidance about what you could testify about here today?
      A	The guidance I got was to be sure not to talk about classified material or anything having to do with privilege, and I think I've abided by those.	I'm not sure exactly what the privilege constraint is.	I don't think I have violated





48


that, and I've certainly not violated anything else.
2 [Discussion off the record.]
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Ah, good point.	I was also

4 instructed not to appear.
5 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
6 Q	Okay.

That's an im portant i nstructi on.

7 A	And in that message, that letter, it said not to
8 appear under current circumstances.	My interpretation of
9 tha t is, when I got a subpoena, that those were different
10 circumstances.
I I	Q	Right.	A subpoena compels your testimony, correct,
12 and that's why you're here today?
13 A	Yes, sir.
14 Q	You indicated that you struggled a little bit over
15 the decision whether or not to take the offer to be the
16 Charge to the mission in Kyiv.	Can you describe in a li ttle
17 bit more detail why you struggled with that decision?
18 A	Yes.	A couple of reasons.	So I was approached
19 with the idea of going back out to Kyiv by Ambassador Volker
20 and then Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent
21 about the time, this would have been like April, May, when it
22 was possible that Ambassador Yovanovitch would be coming back
23 before the regular end of her term.
24 I, of course, was following events in Ukraine, not as
25 closely then as I do now, but was certainly -- as I mentioned

49



in my statement, I cared a lot about the place.	I had seen
2 press reports of the intent of Mr. Giuliani to travel to
3 Ukraine, to pursue these investigations that I've mentioned a
4 couple times in my opening statement, with the intent of
5 using that information in political campaigns.
6 I knew of the -- I knew the people that Giuliani had
7 been talking to in Ukraine.	I knew the prosecutor general,
8 Mr. Lutsenko.	I knew that Mr. Lutsenko had given interviews
9 to American media which were pretty negative about both
10 United States and about the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, in
II particular the Ambassador and the deputy chief of mission.
12 So I knew that they were -- I put it -- I knew there
13 were problems in Kyiv, and I knew there were problems in
14 Washington.	I knew that Secretary Pompeo had received a
15 letter from a Member of Congress or maybe a former Member of
16 Congress -- he's certainly a former Member of Congress now --
17 saying that Masha Yovanovitch, Ambassador Yovanovitch, should
18 be removed.	All to say that I was concerned that there
19 was -- I think I put it -- a snake pit in Kyiv and a snake
20 pit here, and I was not sure that I could usefully serve in
21 that context. 22
23

24
25

50


[10:53 a.m.]
2 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
3 Q	That letter you referenced is from former
4 Representative Pete Sessions?	Is that what you're talking
5 about?
6 A	Correct.
7 Q	In May of 2018?
8 A	Correct.

9 Q

10 A

How did you know about that?
I suppose I had heard that from the State

11 Department -- from Mr. Kent.	I don't know that.
12 Q	What did you know about the circumstances
13 surrounding Ambassador Yovanovitch's removal?
14 A	So I met Ambassador Yovanovitch in Kyiv on several
15 occasions that spring, last spring.	From my position at the
16 United States Institute of Peace, I was an election observer,
17 an international election observer, for the two rounds of the
18 Pres i dent i al electi on.	And on both those visits to Kyi v,
19 those were separated by 3 weeks.	So both of those visits I
20 would check in of course with the embassy and sat down with
2 1	Masha Yovanovitch, with Ambassador Yovanovi tch.
22 We talked in Kyiv about what was going on there and this
23 was disturbing to her.	When I came back from those tri ps, I
24 didn't thi nk much more about that until I got a phone call
25 from George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent,

51


asking hypothetically, he said, would I be willing to go back
2 out to Ukraine, which was odd because we have an Ambassador
3 out there and this gave me some sense that something was
4 going on here.	Shortly thereafter, he called up and said,
5 it's not hypothetical anymore.	Will you go back out?	And
6 that prompted me to do some checking and this kind of
7 business.
8 When Ambassador Yovanovitch came back in what, late May,
9 I think that's right, I talked to her about this and she
10 described the circumstances under which she came back.
II Q	Did you have any understanding as to whether the
12 allegations that were levied against her had any basis in
13 fact?
14 A	No, because I don't think there were allegations
15 well, as she's testified, she was told by the deputy
16 secretary of State that she had done nothing wrong.	So there
17 were no allegati ons of -- as far as any official channel that
18 she had done anything wrong.

19 Q

20 her?
21 A

Were you aware of allegations in the media against


The allegations in the media were that she was

22 tough on corruption.	Now, that doesn't sound so bad, that's
23 what an Ambassador out there has do.	She was very frank, she
24 was very direct.	She made points very clearly, and she was
25 indeed tough on corrupti on, and she named names and that

52


sometimes is controversial out there, but she's a strong
2 person and made those charges.
3 Q	When you say name names, did she generally name
4 names of people or entities to prosecute or not to prosecute?
5 A	No, neither.	She named Ukrainians who were
6 standing in the way of reform of the judiciary in par ti cular.
7 Q	I want to show you a -- what's been marked as
8 Exhibit 1,	which is a May 9th, New York Times article.
9 [Taylor Exhibit No. 1
10 Was marked for i dent i fi cati on.]
II	BY MR. GOLDMA N:
12 Q	You just test i fi ed a second ago that you were aware
13 of efforts by Mr. Giuliani to go to Ukraine to push for
14 i nvesti gati ons.	Do you recognize this article?

15AI do.16QOkay.	Was this what you were referring to?17AIt was.18QAll ri ght.	And if you could just read for usthe19 highlighted paragraph, the second paragraph?
20 A	Mr. Giuliani said he plans to travel to Kyiv, the
21 Ukrainian capital, in the coming days and wants to meet with
22 the nation's President-elect to urge him to pursue inquiries
23 that allies of the White House contend could yield new
24 in format i on about two matters of intense interest to Mr.
25 Trump.

53


Q	Continue, please.
2 A	One is the origin of the Special Counsel's
3 i nve sti gat i on into Russia's interference in the 2016
4 election.	The other is the involvement of former Vice
5 President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.'s son and a gas company owned
6 by a Ukrainian oligarch.
7 Q	And then if you could read the quotation from Mr.
8 Giuliani, two paragraphs down?
9 A	We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling
10 in an investigation, which we have a right to do, Mr.
11 Giuliani said.
12 Q	All right.	And then if you go to the next page and
13 just read the two lines that are highlighted?
14 A	He said that his efforts in Ukraine have the full
15 support of Mr. Trump.	He declined to say specifically
16 whether he had briefed him on the planned meeting with
17 Mr. Zelensky but added he basically knows what I'm doing,
18 sure, as his lawyer.
19 Q	And then if you could go to the last page and the
20 last line and just read tha t.
21 A	My only client is the President of the United
22 States, he said.	He's the one I have an obligation to report
23 to, tell him what happened.
24 Q	So this article is dated May 9th, which as I
25 understand it was during the period that you were considering

54


whether or not to return to Kyiv?
2 A	That's correct.
3 Q	Okay.	And what was your reaction to seeing this
4 article?
5 A	This was one of the several concerns I had when
6 considering whether to accept the offer to go back out to
7 Kyiv.	This was part of the -- one of the two snake pits,
8 this is the Washington snake pit tha t I was concerned I would
9 be stepping i nto if I were to accept the offer.	So this made
10 me less interested, this made me concerned, it troubled me
II	that this is what was affecting U.S. policy towards Ukraine.
12 Q	Did you have any conversations with anyone, any
13 executives or seni or officials at the State Department about
14 your multifaceted concerns?
I 5	A	I did.	I had a conversation with the Counselor
16 Ulrich Brechbuhl and then a conversation with Secretary
17 Pompeo.	And they were -- they were similar in both -- in
18 both meetings I let them know up front going into the meeting
19 tha t I had not decided whether to accept the offer to go back
20 out to Kyiv because I was troubled by what I was hearing, not
21 just this Giuliani article, but I was troubled by other
22 things as well and I made this clear to both, both Mr.
23 Brechbuhl and Secretary Pompeo.
24 And the concern was that the strong support, the policy
25 of strong support for Ukraine, that as I said in my

55


statement, bipartisan, House, Senate, Republicans, Democrats
2 administrations Republicans, Democrats all the way through,
3 that strong support I was worried could change.	And if it
4 did change, I told them both, I couldn't serve.	The counsel,
5 I mentioned that I'd consulted with a mentor , and he said,
6 Bill, if your country asks you to do something you could do
7 i t, if you can be effective.	And the if you can be effective
8 clause is really i mportant .
9 And I could not be effective if our strong support for
10 Ukraine policy were to change and if we were -- if for some
II reason, I couldn't imagine this would happen, but I was
12 worried that there could be some dramatic change where we
13 would agree with the Russians, that well maybe Crimea is
14 Russian after all, you know, or something like that.	And if
15 that were to happen, and I made this clear to the Secretary
16 and others in the room, I would have to come back, I would
17 have to resign, I would have to leave post.
18 Q	And what did Secretary Pompeo say in response to
19 your expression of these concerns?
20 A	He said that he supported the strong U.S. policy
21 and that he would continue to support that strong U.S.
22 policy, and that he would make this case to President Trump.
23 Q	What, if anything, did he say about the snake pit
24 in Washington that you described?
25 A	He said that I should, as the Ambassador, as the

56


Charge out there, that I should follow the guidance and
2 pursue the forei gn policy of the U.S. -- of the
3 administration, of the government, well established.	And he
4 said, and that policy is strong support, economic support,
5 military support, political support, Democratic support
6 and -- and that he would do his best to keep that strong
7 support.
8 Q	Did he in any way mention Mr. Giuliani?
9 A	He didn't.
10 Q	What did Counselor Brechbuhl say to you in response

II	to these concerns?
12 A	Same thing.	Well, he said you need to -- I saw him
13 about 3 days, the Thursday before the Monday meeting with
14 Secretary Pompeo , he said, you'll have an opportunity to ask
15 the Secretary about that.
16 Q	What was Mr. Brechbuhl's view, personally?
17 A	He agreed, he's is not directly in the Ukraine
18 policymaking channel.	He was more in the executive
19 personnel, which is why I was having my -- an interview with
20 him, a meeting with him before seeing the Secretary.
21 Q	Did you specifically mention Mr. Giuliani to either
22 Counselor Brechbuhl or Secretary Pompeo?
23 A	Mr. Goldman, I don't remember if I did, I don't
24 remember if I did or not.
25 Q	Okay.

57


A	Not that I remember.
2 Q	What ultimately led you to take the job?
3 A	The Secretary's assurance that he would continue
4 that strong support and that he would continue to push that
5 strong support within the government.	And frankly one of my
6 concerns had been that there had not been a letter to
7 President Zelensky congratulating him on his victory.	And
8 Secretary Pompeo looked over at Counselor Brechbuhl and said,
9 what, no letter?	And within 48 hours there was a letter.
10 Now -- and it was a good letter -- it's the letter I
1 I	mentioned in my statement that congratulated President
12 Zelensky and invited him to a meeting in Washington.
13 Q	Okay.	That was the May 29th letter that you
14 referenced?
15 A	Correct, correct.	That's right, because I saw
16 Secretary Pompeo on the 28th.
17 Q	By the time you had seen Secretary Pompeo, were you
18 aware that there was a meeting related to Ukraine with the
19 President in the Oval Office on May 23rd?
20 A	Yes.	I think I had heard that .	I know I've heard
21 about that -- I have -- I've gotten reports of that meeting.
22 This was the --this is the meeting of the delegation that
23 went -- the U.S. delegation that went to the inauguration in
24 Kyiv and they came back to brief President Trump, that's the
25 one you' re talking about.

58


Q	Yes.
2 A	Yeah.	So your question is whether or not I knew of
3 that meeting when I saw the Secretary on the 28th.	I don't
4 know when I heard -- I can't remember.	I heard several
5 reports of, descriptions of that May 23rd meet i ng, but they
6 mi ght -- may have come after my meeting with Secretary
7 Pompeo.
8 Q	Who did you get reports of that meeting from?
9 THE CHAIRMA N:	If I could just i nterrupt .	And I don't
10 know all the Members so I apologi ze.	Only members of three
II	committees and their staff and committee staff are authorized
12 to be present.	If there is any Member here who is not a
13 member of the three commi ttees, they need to absent
14 themselves.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	So who did I hear from -
16 BY MR. GOLDMAN:

17 Q
18 A

19 Q
20 A

Yeah.
about the May 23rd meeting, yes?
Right.
I'm sure Kurt Volker	I imagine -- we had several

21 conversations about this, this is an important meeting.	And
22 okay -- and Ambassador Sandland, because it was at that
23 meeting that Ambassador Sandland, Volker and Secretary of
24 Energy Perry, Rick Perry were given some responsibilities by
25 the President to work on Ukraine policy.

59


So I'm sure in answer your question, Mr. Goldman, I'm
2 sure I heard it from Kurt and Gordon, Kurt Volker and Gordon
3 Sondland.
4 Q	And in addition to the fact that the President had
5 asked the three of them to work on Ukraine policy, did you
6 learn anything else about the conversation at that meeting
7 A	I --
8 Q	-- from either Ambassador Volker or Ambassador
9 Sondland?
10 A	I did.	So they described how enthusiastic they
11 were coming back from Kyiv, from the inauguration, how
12 enthusiastic they were about the new President, President
13 Zelensky.	And they described their attempts or their
14 attempts to pass on this enthusiasm to President Trump.
15 President Trump, I think I mentioned in my statement,
16 was sceptical of Ukraine in general, but -- of the new
17 Ukrainian administration.	And when Secretary Perry,
18 Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Sondland suggested that it
19 would be a good idea for the two Presidents, President Trump
20 and President Zelensky to get together in a meeting.	This
21 now is before the letter was signed.	Right, but so the idea
22 to get together for a meeting was a good idea so that
23 President Trump could see himself, what they had seen when
24 they were in Kyiv, and what they had seen in their meetings
25 with President Zelensky.





60


President Trump didn't agree, but what he did say was
2 work with Rudy Giuliani, he told the three of them to work
3 with Rudy Giuliani.
4 Q	Did he say what he wanted them to work with Rudy
5 Giuliani about from your readouts?
6 A	No, not that I recall.
7 Q	By this point you understood that in part based on
8 that article, but you indicate in your opening statement
9 other press statements, did you understand what Rudy Giuliani
10 was pushing for in Ukraine?
11 A	This article that we just talked about was probably
12 the best description and it	it may have been the only
13 direct description of what Mr. Giuliani was interested in.
14 Q	And were you familiar with Burisma or the Ukrainian
15 role at all in the 2016 --
16 A	I became fami li ar, but I -- I think at that time I
17 was not.	In the past several months since seeing this and
18 hearing how it piped up I became more familiar with it so now
19 I'm pretty fami li ar.	At the time, it is hard to say, exactly
20 what you knew at a particular time.	I don't think so.	I -
21 I don't think I understood other than you know, that Giuliani
22 was out doing some things along these lines that this was
23 what he was after.
24 Q	And what was your reaction to hearing that the
25 President had directed the Ambassador to the European Union,




6 1


the Speci al Envoy to the Ukraine confli ct, and the Secretary
2 of Energy to take a role in Ukraine policy and to speak to
3 his personal lawyer?
4 A	Actually, I wasn't disturbed by that.	It's not
5 unusual to ask people outside the government to play a role.
6 In some sense Kurt Volker was kind of outside the government
7 and he was playing a very important role.	He kind of came
8 i nt o the government. a very important role in the
9 negotiations.	There have been examples, we've heard about
10 them recently of other civilians doi ng work for the State
II	Department.	And as long as the people pulled in from the
12 outsi de, consulted from the outside, giving advice or ideas
13 on policy, that's -- we see that all the time.	We all have
14 seen that, and that's okay, as long as i t's consistent with
15 and supports the main thrust of U.S. foreign policy.
16 And so at the time I di dn't th i nk that that was a
17 problem.
18 Q	Over time, did your view of that change?
19 A	It di d.
20 Q	And we'll get into that a little bit later.	Did
21 you come to unders tand whether any of those three i ndi vidual s
22 spoke to Mr. Giuliani after the President directed them to do
23 so on May 23rd?
24 A	I know Kurt, Ambassador Volker, spoke to him on the
25 phone a couple of times, I think had a breakfast with him

62


during the summer.	And as we know, put Rudy Giuliani in
2 touch with Andrey Yermak, the assistant to President
3 Zelensky.
4 So I know that Ambassador Volker had some -- did follow
5 up.	And I'm pretty sure that Ambassador Sandland had some
6 contact with Rudy Giuliani as well.

Q
8 A
9 me see i f
10 Q
11	17th?
12	A

And what about Secretary Perry?
I don't know.	I've had almost no dealings -- let i t's even -- no dealings with Secretary Perry.
You testified that you returned to Kyiv on June


Y

Q	And you described in your opening remarks a phone
14 conversation that you had 10 days later on June 27th with
15 Ambassador Sandland about Ukraine matter s.	Do you recall
16 anything more about that phone conversation with Ambassador
17 Sandland?
18 A	This phone call, Mr. Goldman, was i n preparation
19 for a larger phone call the following day on June 28th.	And
20 I can -- I'd be happy to check my notes on anything else.
21 When preparing this statement, I did check my notes and, as I
22 said in my statement, Ambassador Sandland told me during a
23 phone conversations President Zelensky, needed to make clear
24 to President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not
25 standing in the way of i nves ti gati ons, there could have been

63


othe r parts of the conversation.	That was the one piece tha t
2 stuck out -- sticks out to me that I included here.
3 Q	And did you know at that time what
4 investigations Ambassador Sondland was refer rin g to?
5 A	I did not.	I didn't, you know, I knew that these
6 were	that Mr. Gi uli an i was pu rsui ng some investigations
7 and I hadn't -- again, this was 10 days after arri vi ng there
8 I hadn't put this together.	So no I wasn't sure what he was
9 talking about, nor was I sure the next day, in this larger
10 phone call, what people were referring to when they talked
11 about investigations.
12 Q	And I believe you testified in your opening
13 statement that the call the next day there was a reference to
14 investigations to, quote, "Get to the bottom of thi ngs."
15 unquo te.
16 A	That's correct.	And that was -- Ambassador Volker
17 i ntended to say to President Zelensky when Ambassador Volker
18 sat down with President Zelensky in Toronto at an assistance
19 conference, at a reform conference that was coming up the
20 following week.	And yes, it was -- and again, from my notes
21 in prepar i ng this -- from my notes preparing this, this
22 actually was in the little spiral notebook by my desk in the
23 office where I had that meeting -- had that phone call is
24 where I have that quote.
25 Q	Was the reference to investigations by Ambassador

64


Sandland on June 27th the earliest date or time that you can
2 recall any discussion of investigations?
3 A	And again, before I came out there, we'd had some
4 conversations -- I'm sure that I had conversation with Deputy
5 Assistant Secretary Kent about the Giuliani role, which made
6 me concerned and the role was an investigation so I wanted to
7 be careful about how I answer your question.
8 When I got out there in the first 10 days -- let me see,
9 I did have a meeting	I had a phone call the day after I
10 got there, which was on -- I got there on the 17th.	And on
11 the 18th we had a phone call -- yeah. but it was about -- it
12 was about the meeting, it was about the meeting that the
13 Ukrainians wanted with	that President Zelensky wanted with
14 President Trump.	And I don't recall any discussion on that
15 day, on the 18th, which is again the day after I arrived of
16 investigations and I show nothing else in my notes about
17 that.	So I think that's the answer.
18 Q	Okay.	And you do reference specifically in your
19 opening remarks that President Zelensky needed to make it
20 clear to President Trump that he was not standing in the way
21 of investigations.	And that was a preview to the call that
22 you had with President Zelensky the day after?
23 A	Right.	On June 27th, correct.
24 Q	And do you recall whether or not that message was
25 conveyed to President Zelensky on the call on the 28th?




65


A	It was not.	And -- and Ambassador Volker intended
2 to pass that message in Toronto several days later.
3 Q	Okay.	And did you speak to Ambassador Volker after
4 he went to Toronto in early July?
5 A	Many times.	But about that?
6 Q	Specifically about a conversation that he had with
7 President Zelensky?

8 A
9 Q
10 A

Yes.
And what did he tell you about that conversation? He said that he had been in a broader conversation,

II	a larger conversation with many officials on both sides.	And
12 then he had an opportunity to have a smaller conversation
13 with President Zelensky and President Zelensky's Chief of
14 Staff, Andriy Bohdan, where Kurt said that he had -- Kurt
15 told me that he had discussed how President Zelensky could
16 prepare for the phone call with President Trump.	And without
17 going i nto -- without providing me any details about the
18 specific words, did talk about investigations in tha t
19 conversation with -- in Toronto with Zelensky and Bohdan.
20 Q	In what context did he tell you that he spoke about
21 i nvesti gati ons?

22 A
23 Q

So when did he tell me --
No, in what context did the issue or topic of

24 investigations come up?	Was it in connection with an
25 i nte ra cti on between President Zelensky and President Trump?

66


A	Yes, it was specifically in preparation for the
2 phone call and Kurt suggested to President Zelensky that
3 President Trump would like to hear about the investigations.
4 Q	Okay.	And at that point did you know what
5 investigations he was talking about?
6 A	No.

7 Q	It was
8 A	Correct.

it was just described as investigations?

9 Q	Understood.	You just --
IO	THE CHAIRMAN:	Is there anything more you could tell us
II	about that conversation when he -- when Ambassador Volker
12 said that he discussed investigations with Zelensky's Chief
13 of Staff.	Did you ask him what about that, what are you
14 talking about, you were aware at that time of what Giuliani
15 had said, did it come up in that conversation?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR :	Mr. Chairman, the conversation I had
17 with Ambassador Volker about that -- about the Toronto
18 conversation took place probably -- let's see, so it was
19	July 2nd was the Toronto conversation.	Kurt arrived, he and
20 I talked a lot, and he also visited a couple of times in this
21 timeframe.	And it was during those conversations and visits
22 that we had this conversation.	So nothing specific came out
23 of those conversations describing this.
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	Thank you.
25 BY MR. GOLDMAN:




67



Q	On July 10th you testified that you had a meeting
2 in Kyiv with President Zelensky's Chief of Staff Andriy
3 Bohdan who had indicated to you tha t he had heard from Mr.
4 Giuliani that the phone call between the two Presidents was
5 unlikely to happen and that they I think you said were
6 alarmed and disappointed.	Oh, and the meeting also was the
7 Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko?
8 A	Yeah.
9 Q	Did they indicate to you who had heard from Mr.
IO	Giuliani and how that message had been relayed?
II	A	You know, I was going over my notes last night.
12 Yes, it was relaye d through the then prosecutor general, this
13 fellow I mentioned earlier, Lutsenko and it was -- and as we
14 know, Giuliani and Lutsenko talked a lot.	And so Prystaiko
15 and Bohdan had heard from Giuliani through Lutsenko.
16 Q	What do you know about Mr. Lutsenko?
17 A	When I was in Kyiv 2006 to 2009, Yuriy Lut senko was
18 the Minister of Interior so he headed up all the police.	And
19 frankly he did a pretty good job at the time.	He was a
20 controversial choice for Pres i dent Poroshenko as the
21 Prosecutor General because he -- he had law enforcement with
22 police but had no legal tra ini ng.	So he was an unusual
23 choice.
24 Mr. Lutsenko was loyal to President Poroshenko and so
25 kept his job there.	But was a very ki nd of a person who





68


listened carefully to what was going on in Washington, what
2 was going on in Kyiv, the politics.	He wanted to stay in the
3 job and of course this is 2016 when he i s the Prosecutor
4 General and no one knows about the outcome of the election.
5 So I mean a lot of Ukrainians, probably a lot of
6 internationals around the world were trying to figure out
7 Amer i can poli ti cs at the time, but Lutsenko was also tuned
8 i nto those.
9 Q	But clearly the senior offi ci als for Presi dent
10 Zelensky were interested in anything that Mr. Giuliani had to
11 say.	Is that accurate?
12 A	That's accurate, because they understood, as did

13 Kurt and -- Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sandland, that
14 at Presi dent Trump's direction, Rudy Giuliani was
15 i nfl uentia l, was influential with that team.	And they were
16 sure, and I think Lutsenko had the same view that in order to
17 have this meeting, get this meeting between the two
18 Presidents that Mr. Giuliani was going to be an important
19 player.
20 Q	Did they understand why Mr. Giuliani had indicated
21 that there would -- the phone call was unl i kely to happen?
22 A	I don't know.
23 Q	Okay.	And you said that you relayed these concerns
24 to Counselor Brechbuhl?
25 A	I did.

69


Q	And what did he say to you?
2 A	He -- first he'd heard -- I was hoping I could find
3 out something from Washington that indicated whether or not
4 this phone call was going to happen and he didn't know.
5 Q	Did he get back to you?
6 A	No.
7 Q	You describe a phone conversation that you had with
8 Fiona Hill and Alex Vindman on July 19th at some length in
9 your opening statement.
10 A	Yes.
11 Q	And you refer back to a meeting that occurred on
12	July 10th, while you were in Kyiv, so you were not there.	Is
13 that ri ght?
14 A	That's correct.
15 Q	And based on the phone -- well, let me ask thi s,
16 did you hear about that meeting from anyone other than Dr.
17 Hill and Mr. Vi ndma n on the 19th?
18 A	Yes.	Let's see, so at that meeting -- that meeting
19 included Mr. Danyliuk, as well as Mr. Yermak.	And I thi nk
20 Ambassador Sondland, and it might have been Secretary Perry,
21 and of course Ambassador Bolton were in that meet i ng.	I will
22 find tha t there -- yeah.	Yes.
23 So, Oleksandr Danyliuk is the National Security Advisor
24 so he is Ambassador Bolton's counterpart.	And they had a
25 good meeting there.	So your question was had -- did I hear

70


from other people?	The answer is certainly yes, again with
2 -- back and forth with Kurt Volker so at least those three
3 recounting of that meeting.
4 Q	Did you have any discussions with any Ukrainian
5 officials about that meeting?
6 A	Yes.	When are -- when Oleksandr Danyliuk got back
7 I'm sure we had conversations about i t.	I had also had set
8 him up again as the National Security Advisor for Ukraine.	I
9 also set him up to see in Washington Steve Hadley who had of
IO	course had that job earlier, and they had a good meeting as
11 well.
12 So I did have a conversation with Danyliuk when he got
13 back about with meetings with Hadley and -- but not in great
14 detail about the meeti ng with Ambassador Bolton and team.
15 Q	Okay.	So you outlined in some detail what Dr. Hill
16 and Mr. Vindman describe to you about that meeting.	Is there
17 anything else that you recall that they said about that
18 meeting that comes to mind?
19 A	No.
20 Q	What was your reaction when you heard their
21 description of how Ambassador Sandland had connected
22 inv esti gati ons with the Oval Office meeting and that
23 Ambassador Bolton had directed Dr. Hill to brief the lawyers
24 and Ambassador Bolton's reference to a drug deal?	What was
25 your reaction?




71


A	My reaction was that the opportunity for Oleksandr
2 Danyliuk and John Bolton to have a good conversation was
3 important for Danyliuk.	For him to understand how NSCs work,
4 number one.	And two, what the substantive policy issues in
5 particular the war in the East, and energy security, probably
6 economic reform, the substance -- and they apparently were
7 having a good conversation Bolton and Danyliuk were having a
8 good conversation along these lin es.
9 Maybe toward the end, but certainly after they'd had
10 part of that -- a good amount of that conversation,
II	programmatic conversation, substantive conversation, what I
12 call the regular channel conversation, Fiona Hill and Alex
13 Vindman describe how Ambassador Sondland in that meeting with
14 John Bolton mentioned i nvest i gati ons.
15 And John Bolton understood what the reference was and
16 walked out of the meeting, ended the meeting abruptly.	Not
17 wanting to have that kind of -- he understood, more than I,	I
18 guess at the time, that this was -- this could lead to
19 interference in U.S.- political life and he wanted nothing of
20 it.
21 Q	And that was the description that you had received
22 from Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?

23 A

24 Q

That's correct.
So at this point thin then did you have a better

25 understanding as to what these investigations were that

72


President Trump and Rudy Giuliani wanted in connection with
2 an Oval Office meeting?
3 A	So this is getting into July -- this is, yeah, July
4 10th	yes, I'm beginning to understand that there -- that
5 the i nves ti gati ons, again I'm not sure if ther e's a crystal
6 time, a specific time, but I'm beginning to understand that
7 these investigations of Burisma and the 2016 elections are
8 what the term investigations refer to.
9 Q	And what did you know about the Burisma
10 investigation?
II	A	So Burisma, a London based company that -- energy
12 company that invests a lot and has deali ngs in Ukraine, in I
13 think mainly -- it's in energy, I'm not sure if it's got gas
14 --	had Hunter Biden on its board at an earlier time, maybe
15 back in 2016.	I am not an expert on thi s but this is you
16 asked what I know, this is what I know.
17 This of course is the ti me that Vice President Biden was
18 pushing the Ukrainians very hard on corruption and the
19 allegation -- you know the allegation.	The allegation is
20 that the Vice President wanted to get a Prosecutor General
21 fired in order, the allegation was, to stop the investigation
22 of the Burisma -- the Burisma was a bit of a shady
23 organization I'm told.	Again, I'm not an expert on this.
24 But it had been accused of money laundering and those kinds
25 of things so there were some investigations of it.	I think

73


they may have been closed, the investigation may have been
2 closed under one or the other of the Prosecutors General in
3 the previous time.
4 Q	Did you understand whether the i nvest i gati on
5 desired by Mr. Gi uli ani related to Burisma was connected to
6 the Bidens role in Ukraine and that company in particular?
7 A	It became clear to me with press reports or other
8 discussions, but that emerged, yes.
9 Q	Okay.	I want to give you what we've marked as
10 Exhibit 2, which is a stack of the Wha tsApp messages that
I 1	Mr. Volker had provided to us.
12 [Taylor Exhib i t No. 2
13 Was marked for i dent i fi cati on.]
14

15 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
16 Q	And I would ask you to go to 37, page 37, if you
17 could.	And if you go to 7/21 at 1:45 a.m., which is Eastern
18 ti me.


19 A

20 Q

7 /21.
1:45:54 a.m., right sort of in the middle page.	Do

21 you see it?
22 A	Yes, yes.
23 Q	And if you could read.	This is a text from you on
24 a chain with Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker and you're
25 writing here can you read it?

74


A	And I'm writing, right -- Gordon, one thing Kurt
2 and I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyl i uk's point tha t
3 President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken
4 seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic
5 reelect i on politics.
6 Q	Okay.	And when you had that conversation with
7 Mr. Danyliuk, what did you understand him to be referring to,
8 when you say Washington domestic reelection politics?
9 A	I'm sure that was a reference to the i nvesti gati ons
10 that Mr. Giuliani wanted to pursue.
11 Q	What was your view of the potential telephone call
12 between Presi dent Zelensky and President Trump?
13 A	Ini ti ally, as I said in late like June when I first
14 arrived, this sounded like a good idea.	A good idea to have
15 the two Presidents talk.	In particular if President Trump
16 were skeptical about Ukraine in general and President
17 Zelensky in particular, I thought that would be a good i dea .
18 President Zelensky is a smart man, a good politician.	I
19 would even say charming and he could have a good conversation
20 with President Trump so I thought it was a good idea to have
21 that.
22 As the month of Ju ly went on and some of these suggest
23 this. I was less convi need.	I became less convi need that
24 that meeti ng was worth what Giuliani was asking.	Yes, it
25 would be fine to have the two Presidents talk, but if

75


President Zelensky, in order to get that meeting were going
2 to have to intervene in U.S. domestic policy or politics by
3 investigated -- by announcing an investigation that would
4 benefit someone in the United States, then i t's not -- it
5 wasn' t clear to me that that would be worth it.	That the
6 meeting would be worth i t.
7 Q	Ambassador Sondland then responds to your text 3
8 hours later.	Can you read what he reads?
9 A	Yes, he writes, absolutely.	But we need to get the
10 conversation started and the relationship built irrespective
II of the pretext.	I am worried about the alternative.
12 Q	What did you understand hi m to mean by the pretext?
13 A	I thought about -- I'm not sure I understood, but

14 my	my guess looking back on it is the pretext for the
15 phone call, that is Gordon wanted	he thought that the
16 phone call would be a good idea and wanted it to happen.	And
17 if the discussion of the investigations was what it took,
18 then i t's -- this suggests that that's what he had i n mind.
19 Q	And when he says, I'm worried about the
20 alternative.	What did you understand --
21 A	I guess	again, I'm not sure what is in Gordon's
22 mind, but I guess he was worried that if they di dn't have the
23 meeting i t would not be good for the relationship between the
24 two countries.
25 Q	And is this in reference to the meeting or the

76


phone call?
2 A	Phone call.	I'm sorry, phone call.
3 Q	And that was what was at stake at this point?
4 A	It was at stake at this point.	And the idea was
5 that the phone call would be a step toward the meeting.
6 Q	All right.	Now this is 2 months after -- almost
7 2 months after the letter inviting President Zelensky to the
8 White House.	Is that right?
9 A	That's correct.	The letter from -- it was May 29th
10 and this is July 21st.
I 1	Q	And as the Charge de mission, you're meeting with a
12 number of Ukrainian officials, did you get the sense of
13 whether or not they were getting a little worried or nervous
14 or what was their reaction to the delay in time?
15 A	Yes, they were eager for this meeting.	They wanted
16 the meeting.	They wanted the invitation to the White House.
17 And when it was suggested that a phone call would be a good
18 step toward that, they were willing to do that.	But in
19 answer to your ques ti on, they were very eager to have this
20 meeting.	That was high on their list.
2 1	Q	Why were they so eager?
22 A	A meeti ng -- people in this room will know as well
23 as I, a meeting with the head of state with a U.S. President
24 in the Oval Office suggests a relationship.	It suggests a
25 relationship between the two countries that the Ukrainians

77


wanted.	The Ukrainians value, valued and they value a
2 relationship with the United States as their main strategic
3 partner, as their mainstream partner.
4 So a meeting with President Trump or any President for
5 that matter, but President Trump in the Oval Office doesn't
6 happen regularly -- doesn't happen to very many heads of
7 state.	And if you get that, you can be sure or you can think
8 or people might be able to believe that you've got a good
9 relationship between the two countries and I think that's
10 what they were looking for.
II Q	If I could direct your attention to page 42 now.
12 On Ju ly 22nd, near the top at 4:27.	This is a text exchange
13 between Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland.	You are not on
14 this.	Volker writes to Sondland, orchestrated a great phone
15 call with Rudy and Yermak.	They are going to get together
16 when Rudy goes to Madrid in a couple of weeks.	In the
17 meantime Rudy is now advocating for a phone call.	And Volker
18 explains how he's also advocating for the phone call and then
19 Gordon Sondland responds I talked to Tim Morrison, Fiona' s
20 replacement he is pushing, but feel free as well.
21 Volker had said, but I can tell Bolton and you can tell
22 Mick that Rudy agrees on a call, if that happens.	I assume
23 that means Mick Mulvaney.	Right?

24 A
25 Q

Yes.
Were you aware that Ambassador Volker had connected

78


Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak?
2 A	Not at that point.	I was made aware later.
3 Q	Do you recall when you were made aware?
4 A	No.
5 Q	Did you learn that they had a meeting in Madrid?
6 A	Later.
7 Q	After their meeting?
8 A	Well after.
9 Q	Well after their meeting?
10 A	Yeah.
I I	Q	Okay.	And then if we go to page 19 on 7/25 at 8:36
12 in the morning.	This is a text exchange between Volker and
13 Yermak.	Volker writes to Yermak, good lunch, thanks.	Heard
14 from White House.	Assuming President Z convinces Trump he
15 will investigate/ quote, "get to the bottom of what happ ened"
16 unquote, in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to
17 Washington.	Good luck see you tomorrow.	Kurt.
18 Have you seen this text before?
19 A	Yes.	I think I've seen it in the paper.
20 Q	As part of this investigation?
21 A	Right, right.	I wasn' t on it.
22 Q	So you were not on this one?
23 A	Correct.
24 Q	But were you aware that this message, that Volker
25 texted to Yermak, were you aware that that message was

79


relayed to the senior Ukrainian officials in advance of the
2 phone call?
3 A	Yes.	This is the basic message that Kurt -- that
4 Ambassador Volker provided to President Zelensky and Bohdan
5 in Toronto on the 2nd of July, i t's very consistent.
6 Q	And is it your view that by this point the White
7 House meeting between President Zelensky and President Trump
8 was conditioned on the initiation of these investigations by
9 Ukraine?
IO	A	I am sure that happened based on all the things I
II said.	So Mr. Goldman, you asked me did I know it at that
12 point or on 7/25?
13 Q	Right.
14 A	The answer must be yes, yeah.	I knew it in July it
15 became clearer and clearer.
16 Q	Okay.	And you did not -- you said it was I think
17 somewhat strange that you did not get a readout of the July
18 25th call.	Is that right?
19 A	That's correct.	It's a li ttle strange, it's not a
20 lot strange.	We didn't get very many readouts, but
21 Q	And I believe you were in Kyiv and so was
22 Ambassador Volker and Sondland?

23 A

24 Q
25 A

Correct.
At this time? That's correct.





80


Q	Did any Ukrainian official whether it was Zelensky
2 or any of their senior officials say anything to you during
3 the i r vi si t, perhaps at a dinner that you had with
4 Mr. Danyliuk about these investigations, was that on the ir
5 mind at tha t point?
6 A	We did have dinner with Gordon Sondland, and
7 Danyliuk, and Kurt the night before the discussion -- so
8 yeah, that	the night before the d i scussi on, so on the
9 25th, yes.	But the brief conversation that we had with
10 Danyliuk about that was that they seemed to think that the
11 call went fine, the call went well.	He wasn't disturbed by
12 anything.	He wasn't disturbed that he told us about the
13 phone call.
14 THE CHAIRMAN:	Ambassador, our time has expired.	It's
15 my intention after the minority has their 1 hour to take a
16 brief lunch break.	Would you like a rest room break now
17 before we begin?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm fine, I'm fine.	I appreciate
19 the offer.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Thank you.	1 hour to the
21 minority, sir.
22 BY MR. CASTOR:
23 Q	Thank you, Ambassador.	Than k you for your service
24 50 years of fa i thful service to the United States.	We trul y
25 appreciate that.	To the extent any of our questions here

81


today you belie that, let me just state at the outset we
2 appreciate your service.
3 A	Thank you, Mr. Castor.
4 Q	I also want to express condolences to Mr. Cummings'
5 staff, they rejoined us today, Susanne Grooms, Peter Kenny.
6 Mr. Cummings treated his staff like family and his staff
7 treated him like family as well.	So they are hurting and we
8 are glad they are back today.
9 You're here today under subpoena.	Is that correct?
IO	A	Yes, sir.
I I	Q	Would we be able to have a copy of the subpoena?
12 We've never seen i t.	A lot of these subpoenas -- some of
13 them we have seen, others we have not.
14 MR. GOLDMAN:	The HPSCI minority saw the subpoena before
15 it was --
16 MR. CASTOR:	Could we make it like an exhibit?	Usually
17 when a witness is appearing per subpoena, you make it an
18 exhibit.	Can we do that?
19 MR. GOLDMAN:	We'll consider that and get back to you.
20 MR. CASTOR:	So the answer is no?
21 MR. GOLDMAN:	No, I said we'll consider that and get
22 back to you.
23 MR. CASTOR: So -- okay.
24 BY MR. CASTOR:
25 Q	When did you first learn the subpoena was coming?

82




2A

QThis morning.
Okay.	What time?3A8:30?	8:30.4QWas it your understanding all along that a subpoena
5 was likely to
6 A	I'd seen the pattern of other witnesses who were
7 under the same instruction I was and presumably we were under
8 the same constrain t and that when they received the subpoena
9 right before they appeared, so I was anticipating the same
10 thing.
11 Q	And a handful of State Department officials have
12 come in so far, Ambassador Yovanovitch, Deputy Assistant
13 Secretary Kent, Ambassador McKinley.	Although I don't think
14


15 A

16 Q

17 correct?

Ambassador Sandland.
Ambassador Sandland.	And they all had subpoenas,

18 A	Correct, that's my understand.
19 Q	Not Ambassador McKin ey.	So the State Department
20 is well aware of this pattern?
21 A	Very well aware.
22 Q	Okay.	You mentioned the circumstances.	If the
23 ci rcumstance s changed, you believe you would be allowed to
24 testify pursuant to the subpoena.	They weren't ordering you
25 not to appear over the subpoena, were they?




83


A	No.
2 Q	Okay.	Did anyone at the State Department reach out
3 to you either in Hor L when it became a foregone conclusion
4 that these subpoenas are coming?	Did anybody reach out to
5 you to communicate that should a subpoena be issued, you
6 should not testify?
7 A	Can I ask counsel to answer that , because they had
8 interaction with the State Department lawyers.
9 MR. CASTOR:	Okay.
10 MR. BELLINGER:	After his initial conversations with H,
11 then all further conversations were from the L lawyer to me.
12 They sent us the directive that said that he should not
13 appear under I think the quote is under the present
14 circumstances.	We told the majority that we could not
15 appear; he'd been instructed not to.	We saw the pattern.
16 The L said to us, if you get a subpoena, we're not
17 prohibiting you from appearin g, but if you do appear,
18 ultimately under a subpoena then you have to protect
19 classified information and other information.	So that was
20 the back and forth with the lawyers at the State Department.
21 MR. CASTOR:	Okay, thank you.
22 BY MR. CASTOR:
23 Q	I apologize for asking you some of these details a
24 lot of those, on the Republican side of things, we're in the
25 dark about many of these blow by blow when the subpoena, is





84


the subpoena going to go.	And that leads to mistrust.	Some
2 of the other machinations about you can't	we can't have
3 copies of the transcript, we're only allowed two staffers in
4 the room from the Oversight Committee, leads to questions of
5 this sort.	So that's why I ask.	So I appreciate that.
6 You mentioned that the company Burisma was a bit of a
7 shady organization?
8 A	Mr. Castor, I don't want to say more than I know.
9 And again, as I mentioned to Mr. Goldman, I learned about
10 Burisma -- I don't think I knew about Burisma before spring,
11 before this past spring when I was thin ki ng about coming back
12 out to Kyi v.	So what I know about Burisma is recent and you
13 and I have probably read the same thing.
14 Q	Okay.	So you're aware that after you left your
15 first tour as Ambassador, I think it's in 2014 thi s former
16 ecology minister Zlochevsky, it's alleged that he improperly
17 obtained certain licenses.
18 A	I've hea rd that.
19 Q	Okay.	And there are a number of allegations
20 surrounding the company since 2014 relating Zlochevsky,
21 you're familiar with those?
22 A	Not in any detai l.
23 Q	Do you have any reason to dispute that these things

24 occurred?
25 A	I have no reason.




85


Q	When you arrived at the embassy did your staff
2 br i ef you about about some of the oli garchs and the
3 environment of corruption?
4 A	In general certa i nly.	I don't recall a specific
5 briefing on Burisma.
6 Q	Okay.	Was the name everybody mentioned i n any of
7 those briefings?
8 A	It has certain ly been mentioned since, you know,
9 and over the past couple of months when it has shown up in
10 the papers.
11

12

[11:53 a.m.]
2 BY MR. CASTOR:
3 Q	And what you can you tell us about other oligarchs
4 that might allegedly be involved with corruption in Ukraine?
5 A	A general question, okay.
6 Q	Is it an issue?
7 A	It's a big i ssue.	It's a big i ssue.	And it's
8 particularly a big issue today with this new administration.
9 The one problem, the one concern, the one issue that we have,
10 the U.S. Government and the international community more
I I	broadly, with this administration, with the Zelensky
12 administration, is the influence of oligarchs.
13 Now, the influence of one particular oligarch over Mr.
14 Zelensky is of particular concern, and that's this fellow
15 Kolomoisky, so -- and Kolomoisky has growing influence.	And
16 this is one of the concerns that I have expressed to
17 President Zelensky and his team on several occasions very
18 explicitly, saying that, you know, Mr. President, Kolomoi sky
19 was not elected.	You were elected and he, Mr. Kolomoisky, is
20 increasing his influence in your government, which could
21 cause you to fail.	So I've had tha t conversation with him a
22 couple of times.
23 Q	And you're aware from -- at various points in time
24 some these oligarchs, some of these companies have been under
25 i nvesti gat i on?

87


A	Yes.
2 Q	For various reasons?
3 A	Yes.
4 Q	We understand Burisma, from additional witness
5 testimony, has been -- either Burisma or Zlochevsky has been
6 under investigation for money laundering, for tax evasion,
7 among other things.	And you're familiar with that generally?
8 A	I am familiar with that generally.
9 Q	What can you say about the integrity of the
10 criminal justice system in Ukraine?
II A	Flawed.
12 Q	So is it fair to say tha t if some of these
13 companies, some of these oligarchs had been under
14 investigation at some point in time that the investigation
15	may have been closed for i mproper purposes?
16 A	Yes.	It could have been closed for payments, yes.
17 Q	So, inherently, the interest of somebody in the
18 United States of wanting to -- wanting Ukraine to get to the
19 bottom of corrupt i on is not a problem, right?
20 A	We have long made it, over -- certainly while I was
21 there in 2006-2009 and subsequently, have long made it clear
22 to the Ukrainian Governments over tim e that their ability to
23 integrate into Europe and succeed in that goal was challenged
24 by, was threatened by, a lack of credible rule of law, which
25 included courts, investigations.





88


So yes, that's been a constant theme of U.S. policy
2 towards Ukraine.
3 Q	Okay.	So, to the extent somebody in the United
4 States, whether it be at the State Department or the National
5 Security Council or even the White House, has questions about
6 whether i nvest i gati ons were properly closed and ought to be
7 reopened is something that is a product of the environment,
8 correct?
9 A	We look very carefully at the operation and the
10 implementation of the justice system in Ukraine, again,
I I	because of its importance for i nvestment , because of its
12 importance for trust in the government, because of the
13 importance of having confidence that an objective ru le of law
14 system, a judiciary system, was so important for it.
15 So that, in general -- now, you know -- yeah, that, in
16 general, has been our policy.
17 Q	But if Zlochevsky or Burisma is under investigation
18 for money laundering, tax evasion, and those cases are
19 closed, as you suggest, because they were paid off, the
20 prosecutors were paid off, then certainly it's okay to want
21 those cases to be reopened?
22 A	The policy that I've been aware of has been a
23 general policy of the importance of honest judges, of the
24 selection process for judges, the selection process for
25 prosecutors, the i nsti tuti ons.	It has been less a focus on




89


i ndi vi dual cases.	Indivi dua l cases, in my view, is not what
2 U.S. -- what U.S. forei gn policy.	What we need to press on
3 is strengthening the in sti tut i ons in Ukraine, but i n other
4 countries as well, so that the population, the soci ety has
5 confi dence in it.	So it's more the institution than the
6 specific case.
7 Q	Are you aware of the effort of Burisma in 2014 to,
8 you know, assemble a hi gh-pr ofi le board of dir ectors?
9 A	So 2014, I was not paying great attention to that
10 aspect.	So what I know, probab ly what we all know i s that
II they put some very hi gh- profi le people on their board.
12 Again, I've only come to know that over the past couple of
13 months because of all the attention.	So I know thi s -- I
14 di dn't know it in 2014 because I was at the Institute of
15 Peace trying to do Iraq or Afghani stan, whatever.
16 Q	And one of the folks they put on the board was
17 Hunter Biden, right?
18 A	That's my understanding.
19 Q	Do you know if he has any experience in corpora te
20 governance?
21 A	I don't know.	I don't know Hunter Biden.	I don't
22 know what he
23 Q	Do you think i t's possible that he was tapped for
24 the board because his dad was the Vice President?
25 A	So, Mr. Castor, I'm here as a fact witness.	I

90


don' t have any facts on that.	I don't have an opinion on
2 that, and you don't want me -- my
3 Q	But a reasonable person could say there are
4 perceived conflicts of interest there, right?
5 A	Sure.
6 Q	In your time as Ambassador, the first stint '06 to
7 '09 and then again, have any -- has anyone asked the Embassy
8 whether you had an issue about putting certai n officials on
9 their board?
10 A	Recently, there have been questions about -- well,
11 recently there have been questions about boards of Naftogaz.
12 So the answer is yes, in that case.
13 Another set of issues are the corporate boards of the
14 state-owned banks.	And decisions about who is appointed to
15 the state-owned bank boards has been an issue for the	for
16 the independence of the National Bank of Ukraine, the NBU, in
17 conflict with the administration.
18 So the short answer is yes, the board membership has
19 been an issue that we've paid some attention to.

20QOkay.	And what's the Embassy's ordinary posture21when itcomes to that?22AThe23QDo you24AThe selection process -- so what	again, the25examplesI just gave you, the Naftogaz and the state-owned
91


banks, our policy on those, being -- both being state-owned,
2 all of those being stat e-owned banks and Naftogaz, the
3 selection process, open, competitive, transparent.
4 I don 't know that that -- I don't remember seeing any
5 specific of privately owned companies that -- or the boards
6 on privately owned companies.	So the interest in board
7 membership is of -- that I'm familiar with is state-owned
8 companies, the ones I've mentioned.
9 [Discussion off the record.]
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: No, it's actually - - the open
II	competition is for contracts as well as an open competitive
12 selecti on process for board members.
13 BY MR. CASTOR:
14 Q	You mentioned in your opener that you're on the
15 board of a small Ukrainian
16 A	I was.	I'm not on, but I was, yeah.	It's called
17 the East Europe Foundati on.	Yeah.
18 Q	Okay.	Any other board memberships for you?
19 A	I was, again, on the board of the American
20 Councils, both nongovernmental organizations here in
21 Washington.
22 Q	Okay.	Any of these boards pay you $50,000 a month
23 for your service?
24 A	No.	They pay nothing.
25 MR. CASTOR:	I want to mark as exhibit 3 a Poli ti co

92


article from January.
2 [Minority Exhibit No. 3
3 was marked for identification.]
4 MR. CASTOR:	Anybody need copies of this?	We try to
5 bring enough copies for at least four or five people, and so
6 to the extent you guys could reciprocate, we'd appreciate
7 that.	You've been handing us one copy, and I have to share
8 i t with our members, and it gets tricky.
9 BY MR. CASTOR:
10 Q	This is a Poli ti co article dated January 2017.	Can
II	you identify the article -- or the author for the record?
12 A	Mr. Castor, I don't know the two authors.
13 Q	Yes, could you just say their name?
14 A	Oh, sorry.	Kenneth Vogel and David Stern.

15 Q
16 A

17 Q
18 A

19 Q
20 A

Going back to exhibit 1, the New York Times story. Yes.
Who wrote that one? Kenneth Vogel.
Would you mind readi ng the highlighted paragraph? "Ukrainian Government officials tried to help

21 Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning
22 his fitness for office.	They also disseminated documents
23 implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested that
24 they were i nvest i gati ng the matter, only to back away after
25 the election, and they helped Clinton's allies research




93


damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico
2 investigation found."
3 Q	Now, you weren't in the Ukraine in 2017.	Had you
4 been aware of any of these issues

5 A	No.
6 Q



from your post at -

7 A	At the Inst i tute, no.
8 Q	Are you aware of the allegation that a
9 DNC-connected consultant was communicating with the Ukrainian
10 Embassy here in D.C.?
II	A	I have recently heard that.
12	Q	And have you ever heard the name 

13
14 A	Again, I think in that same connection where I've
15 recently heard that issue that you	the connection that you
16 just described, I think that's the name.	That's about the
17 limit of my knowledge on tha t.

18 Q

Fair enough.	When you arrived at post, did anybody

19 give you briefings about
20 A	They didn't.
21 Q	or - -
22 A	They d i dn't.
23 Q	efforts of the DNC to influence Ukrainians in
24 the U.S.?
25 A	They didn't.

94


Q	Okay.	So your sum total of knowledge of that comes
2 from news accounts?
3 A	I think that's right.	It's -- I think that's
4 right.	It's -- I could have also had a conversation with
5 somebody about that, but that was also based on news
6 accounts.
7 Q	Were you aware that the Ukrainian Ambassador to the
8 U.S., Chaly, had entered the fray, the political fray, and
9 wrote an op-ed in opposition to then-candidate Trump?


10 A

11 Q

12 A

I was not aware.
Is that ordinary or --
It's not.	Ambassadors do not -- are not supposed

13 to and should not interfere in or participate in domestic
14 elections, the host country elections.
15 Q	Did anyone at the Embassy ever call to your
16 attention the issue with Ambassador Chaly?
17 A	In this context, no.	In other contexts, in
18 particular the Zelensky administration, the new
19 administration was looking to replace him as soon as they
20 could once they came into office.	This, of course, was this
21 past summer.
22 Q	Okay.	And is that common?	Had Chaly served for a
23 couple Presidents or was he linked to Poroshenko?
24 A	He -- I think he only served under Poroshenko.	He
25 was a professional Foreign Service officer, so he undoubtedly




95


had earlier in his career in other things, but in terms of
2 that Ambassadorship.
3 Q	On page 11 of this story, there's a reference to a
4 Ukrainian investigative journalist and, at the tim e, a
5 Parli amentari an named Serhiy Leschenko.	What do you know
6 about Mr. Leschenko?
7 A	So Mr. Leschenko is a known reformer journalist
8 who, in 2014, when the so-called Revolution of Dignity,
9 decided to join the government -- well, run for office and
10 was elected to the Rada, to the Parliament, where he
11 continued to be associated with a group of reformers.
12 Q	And is he still in the Parliament?
13 A	Is he in the Parli am ent?	I think he's not.
14 Q	Do you know if he's ever been i nvest i gated or
15 prosecuted?
16 A	He has been.	He has been investigated.	Again,
17 this is not my -- this is before I arrived.
18 Q	If you know.
19 A	Yeah.	He has been investigated, and a court -- I
20 don't remember which court -- dismissed the charge.

21QOkay.	Are you aware of the allegations relating to22Leschenkoand the Manafort ledgers?23AYes.24QAnd what do you know about that?25AAs I understand it, he was the one who -- Serhiy
96


Leschenko was the one who either found or identified the
2 ledger, and either he or someone in law enforcement turned
3 that ledger over to the Anticorruption Bureau.	That's what I
4 remember.
5 Q	On page 11, there's a paragraph that beg i ns, "The
6 scrutiny around the ledgers" --
7 A	Yes.
8 Q	"combined with that from othe r stor i es about his
9 Ukraine work -- proved too much, and he stepped down from the
10 Tr ump campaign less than a week afte r the Times story."
I 1	And that's relating to Manafort.
12 A	Yes.
13 Q	"At the ti me, Leschenko suggested that his
14 moti vat i on was partly to underm i ne Trump."
15 Was i t well-known that Leschenko was, indeed, trying to
16 undermine candidate Trump at the time?
17 A	So this would have been what year?	Not to me.
18 Yeah, it was a 2017 arti cle, but I don' t know when they were
19 talking about here.
20 Q	These things were occur r i ng during the 2016
21 election.
22 A	2016 election, right.	Not known to me.
23 Q	Okay.	When you arrived at post, did your poli ti cal
24 adviser there or anybody give you a bri efi ng on some of the
25 issues relati ng to Leschenko?




97


A	One of the questions was -- so I mentioned he was a
2 reformer.	One of the -- and he had supported Zelensky,
3 President Zelensky, and had given him, had given Zelensky
4 some credibility as a reformer.	The other reformer, by the
5 way, we've already talked about is a man named Alexander
6 Danyliuk.	And so those two people joined Zelensky 's team
7 early as reformers.
8 What I was told, in answer to your question,
9 Mr. Counselor, was that Leschenko took himself off of the
10 Zelensky team because of these	this controversy.
11 Q	Okay.	At the bottom of page 11, the report, the
12 Politico report notes that Leschenko told the Financial
13 Times, you know, about 2 weeks after the news conference that
14 he was trying to undermine candidate Trump.
15 The newspaper goes on to note , the Financial Times, that
16 Trump's candidacy had spurred Kyiv's wider political
17 leadership to do something they would never have attempted
18 before, intervene, however indirectly, in a U.S. election.
19 What do you know about attempts of the Ukrainian
20 Government or Ukrainians to intervene in the 2016 election?
21 A	Mr. Castor, I don't know about those attempts.
22 Q	Okay.	And has that been part of any br i efi ngs that
23 you received once you arrived at post?
24 A	No.
25 Q	Okay.	And so that's not a concern that's been

98


communicated to you as you've settled in?
2 A	Correct.
3 Q	Flipping over to page 14, the paragraph begins
4 "Ukrain e's Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov."	You

5 with me?
6 A	Fourteen.	Yes.	Yep.
7 Q	Okay -- piled on, trashing Trump on Twi tter as a
8 clown and asserting that Trump is an even bigger danger to
9 the U.S. than terrorism.
10 The Politico story goes on to report that Avakov also
11 disparaged the President in Facebook posts.
12 What do you know about Avakov?
13 A	So he is the Minister of Inte rna l Affairs and was
14 the Minister of Internal Affairs under Presi dent Poroshenko
15 as one of only two carryovers from the Poroshenko Cabinet to
16 the Zelensky Cabinet.	He, as I think I mentioned earlier
17 when we were talking about Lut senko, the Minister of
18 Interior, which Avakov is now, controls the police, which
19 gives him significant i nfluence in the government.
20 Q	Avakov, he's a relatively i nfluen ti al Minister.	Is
21 that right?
22 A	That i s correc t.
23 Q	Does it concern you that at one time he was being
24 highly critical of candidate Trump?
25 A	It does.




99


Q	And did you ever have any awareness of that before
2	I called your attention to this?


3

4	but
5

A	I haven't.	This is surprising.	Disappointing,


Q	Flipping to page 15, the paragraph that begins with

6 "Andri y Artemenko."
7 A	At the top. yeah.
8 Q	Ukrainian Parliamentarian associated with
9 conservative opposition, you know. met with Trump's team
10 during the campaign.	And he was quoted saying:	It was clear
II they were supporting Hillary Cli nton's candidacy.	They did
12 everything from organizing meetings with the Clinton team to
13 publicly supporting her to criticizing Trump.	I think they
14 simply didn't meet because they thought Hillary would win.
15 This is yet another Ukrainian Parliamentarian, you know,
16 going on the record in a news account asserting that the
17 Ukrainian Government establishment was, in fact, supporting
18 Hillary Clinton.
19 Is this a new fact for you?

20 A	This is a new fact for me.
21 article.	So this was a 2017 article.

I've not read this So I di dn 't know

22 that -- I don't know Artemenko, so I haven't had a chance to
23 deal with him.	And the answer is yes, new fact.

24 Q

25 A

Does it concern you?
Yes.	Same thing, for the same reason.

100


Q	Now, is it reasonable for someone in the Trump
2 administration to conclude that if Artemenko -- and I
3 apologize if --
4 A	No, you're doing fine.
5 Q	-- any of my pronunciations are --
6 A	You're doing fine.
7 Q	If Artemenko, Chaly, Avakov, Leschenko were
8 engaged -- these are all legitimate people in the Ukraine,
9 r i ght?


10 A

11 Q

12 A
I 
don' t know how legitimate Artemenko is, but -- He's an elected member of the Parliament?
He's an elected member of the Parliament, which

13 means -- which may mean that he could -- you can buy your way
14 into the Parliament.
15 Q	Okay.	But certainly a government official?
16 A	Certainly a -- a deputy, a Rada deputy, yeah.
17 Q	Avakov is a leg i ti mate power player in Ukraine?
18 A	At least a power player, that's right.	That's
19 right.

20 Q
21 A

22 Q

And Chaly is the Ambassador to the U.S.? Chaly is the Ambassador.
Okay.	And Leschenko was a man of some

23 significance, right?
24 A	Leschenko was a well-known reformer and a well --
25 and a good journalist beforehand, so yes, well-recognized.

101



Q	So isn't it possible that Trump administration
2 officials might have a good-founded belief, whether true or
3 untrue, that there were forces in the Ukraine that were
4 operating against them?
5 A	Mr. Castor, based on this Politico article, which,
6 again, surprises me, disappoints me because I think it's a
7 mistake for any diplomat or any government official in one
8 country to interfere in the political life of another
9 country.	That's disappointing.
10 Q	So the question is, isn't it fair to say that, if
II you're aligned with the Trump administration, isn't it
12 legitimate to have a good-faith belief that Ukrainians were
13 operating against you in the 2016 election?
14 A	That's certainly the thrust of this article.
15 Q	And this isn't an opinion piece.	I mean, this is
16 not an opinion piece.	This is a journalist
17 A	This is a journalist.	And, as you pointed out,
18 it's Kenneth Vogel, who also writes for The New York Times.
19 Q	So it's not a fringe, you know, journalist.	I
20 mean, this is a mainstream journal i st for Politico and now
21 the New York Times, not an opinion piece.	And to the extent
22 he's reporting and documenting these facts, I mean, isn't it
23 fair to say that if you're aligned with the Trump
24 administration, you might have a good-faith belief that the
25 Ukrainians were supporting Hillary Clinton and trying to

102



undermine him?
2 A	You could have that opinion, tha t some were.	If
3 this reporting is correct, you could certainly have the
4 opinion that some Ukrainians were.
5 Q	Okay.	And do you have any	since you've arrived
6 at post, has anyone briefed you to try to debunk any of these
7 allegations?
8 A	No.
9 Q	Okay.	So nobody at the Embassy has sat you down in
I O	bri efi ngs and sai d , "Am bassador, there are allegati ons out
II ther e that the Ukrainians were working for Clinton and
12 against Trum p, but I want to tell you that didn't happen";
13 nobody came and briefed you on that?

14ACorrect.15QSince your ti me consideringthe post, which I think16 you I think you ment i oned was the end of May, and then you
17 arrived relatively qu i ckly, to your credit, in June, did you
18 get any background on some of the concerns that the folks
19 al i gned with the President had about the Ukrainians
20 interfering with the election, or allegedly?
21 A	No.	Mr. Giuliani and his -- who is influential
22 with the President, and his efforts were known.	I wouldn't
23 say	I wouldn't say "bri efed."	What the Embassy tries to
24 do, as a general rule, is stay out of either our domestic or
25 Ukraine internal politics.	So we have not -- we have tried




103


to avoid dealing certainly with Mr. Giuliani and the kind of
2 efforts that he was interested in.	So that's, again, for
3 we don't get involved in election campaigns on either side.
4 Q	But you describe a difficult environment leading up
5 to Ambassador Yovanovitch's recall, and you testified about
6 some of the concerns you had before accepting the post.
7 Did anyone give you any additional background about what
8 the issues are that concerned the President or was motivating
9 Mr. Giuliani?


10 A

I I	Q

No.
Okay.	Did you have a general understanding of what


12 Giuliani's concerns were?
13 A	Again, our focus has -- we've attempted to keep the
14 focus on our bilateral relations and away from domestic
15 politics or Ukrainian internal politics, to the degree we
16 can.	So
17 Q	Just forgive me.	If there was a concern about the
18 2016 election and concern about investigations, did you ever
19 try to do some due diligence and find out exactly what the
20 concerns were before you arrived at post?
21 A	No.
22 Q	Did you have any conversations with Yovanovitch
23 about this?
24 A	About
25 Q	The environment, the snake pit I think you called

104


i t.
2 A	Certainly, we had -- I had a conversation with her
3 in Kyiv and then again in Washington about the -- about that
4 environment, about how the domestic, our domestic politics
5 had gotten into the -- into affecting her career.
6 Q	Okay.	But did you ever have a discussion about
7 what, you know, when you're -- did you ever try to get into
8 the -- what was the genuine concern from Giuliani, other
9 than

10 A

I I	Q

12 said

No.
Okay.	You met with Yovanovitch a couple ti mes, you

13 A	Yes.
14 Q	-- when you were over there as an election
15 observer.
16 A	Yes.
17 Q	And then you met with her again after she came
18 home

19 A

20 Q
21 A
22 Q
23 A

24 Q
25 A

Correct.
-- before you went out? Correct.
So is that roughly three conversations? Three conversations, at least, yeah.
And what do you recall her telling you?
I recall in particular the last conversation, which

105



was in my office at the Institute of Peace.	She was very
2 emotional about having been pulled out early.	As she has
3 indicated, she didn't think she had made mistakes or done
4 something wrong.	She felt like someone had -- she felt that
5 someone or some people may have had other motives for wanting
6 her not to be there.
7 And I think she's indicated that maybe in her testimony
8 or the papers or something that has described her testimony.
9 She made that same point to me in May.
10 Q	Did she say who?
11 A	I don't recall her mentioning any specific names.
12 I'm not even sure she knew the people.	She had a sense that
13 there were people who wanted to invest in Ukraine or wanted
14 to sell things to Ukra i ne that thought that he r
15 anticorruption stance was getting in their way.	I don't
16 remember -- if she mentioned any names, I don't re member
17 them.
18 Q	Okay.	Did y6u have any discussions -- how many
19 discussions did you have with Brechbuhl before tak i ng the

20 post?
21 A

22 Q



Two.
And during those two discussions, did you have any

23 dialogue with him about what was going on over there?
24 A	Again, he -- with Counselor Brechbuhl, i t was
25 more	the two conversations were on like the 23rd of May

100


and the 28th of May, and the second with the Secretary.	And
2 they were focused more on my interest, my qualifications,
3 rather than anything about Ukraine policy.
4 Q	Did they ever tell you they'd have your back?
5 A	Secretary Pompeo did say that he'd support me on
6 thi s strong Ukraine policy.	That was my condition for going
7 out, and he said he would.
8 Q	And did you have a relatively open communication
9 with both Counselor Brechbuhl and the Secretary?
10 A	Yes.
11 Q	So, if you needed them, they would engage with you,
12 right?

13 A

14 any time.

They would.	And I didn't -- and the Secretary said I didn't abuse that and I only -- but I did call

15 the counselor a couple of times, you know, and -- from Kyiv.
16 So I met with him twice While I was -- before I left, called

17 him a couple times to check in when I started to get
18 concerned about the security assistance, for example.	But
19 yes, he was available and responsive.
20 Q	Okay.	Did you ever have any discussions with the
21 Secretary or the counselor about the circumstances of
22 Ambassador Yovanovitch being recalled?
23 A	That was a concern I had before I agreed with them
24 to take the job.	So i t may -- it could have been part of
25 that conversation, Mr. Castor.	I don't recall speci fi cally

107


talking to them about Ambassador Yovanovitch.
2 Q	Did they ever give you any assurances that this
3 won't happen again and --
4 A	No, no.	I didn't ask for and didn't receive any.
5 Q	Okay.	The issues that motivated her recall, did
6 they give you any indication that they were still viable
7 issues that made the environment tricky?
8 A	They didn't.

9 Q

10 A

I I	Q

But you expected it would be?
I expected it would be.
Did you ever have any communications with Mr.

12 Giuliani
13 A	None.
14 Q	- - directly?
15 A	No.	He visited Kyiv in 2008 or '07, while I was
16 there.	2008, I  think.	And I remember shaking his hand.	He
17 was America's mayor.	But otherwise, not.
18 Q	But for times relevant, May 28th on, you've never
19 spoken to Mr. Giuliani?
20 A	No, no.
21 Q	Has anyone ever asked you to speak to Mr. Giuliani?
22 A	No.
23 Q	And if I may, have you spoken to the President of
24 the United States?
25 A	I have not.

108



Q	Okay.	You had no communications with the President2ofthe United States?3A	Correct.4Q	Have you had any communications with Acting Chief5ofStaff Mulvaney?6A	None.7Q	The White House officials you have had discussions
8 with, have you i dent i fi ed them for the most part in your
9 statement?

10 A

I I	Q

Yes.
Okay.	So i t's Ambassador Bolton, Fiona Hill, Dr.

12	Hi ll, Mr. Vi ndman, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?

13AVindman, right.14QAny others that were15ATim Morrison took16QTim Morrison.17A-- Fiona's place.18QOkay.19AYeah, I think those are the ones.20QAnd once you arrived at post, did you have any
21 occasion to engage the Secretary on any of these issues, ask
22 the Secretary for his assistance in pushing back on the
23 i rr egular part of the policy?
24 A	So I went to the Secretary at the end of August in
25 a -- in a cable expressing my concern about -- August 29th,

109



my concern about the hold on security assistance.
2 Q	Okay.	Was that the first time you engaged the
3 Secretary on this?
4 A	Yes.
5 Q	Okay.	In your statement, you walk us through what
6 was a regular, formal, diplomatic process that you were the
7 point person for, and then there was an irregular, informal
8 channel, and that was concerning to you.	Is that fair?
9 A	Not at the beginning.
10 Q	Okay.
I 1	A	At the beginning, as I said, I felt the goals were
12 aligned.	I thought the goals of having -- the overall goal
13 of having strong U.S.-Ukraine relations was supported by --
14 certainly by -- I knew by Ambassadors Sondland and Volker.
15 I didn't - - I never, as I said, haven't had much
16 dealings with Secretary Perry, but everything leads me to
17 believe that he also supported that.	And so that irregular
18 is not necessarily bad.
19 Q	Okay.
20 A	And it wasn't -- I didn't think it was bad.	I
21 didn't think it was a problem in the beginning.	And,
22 actually, it could have been helpful, because Ambassador
23 Sondland is able	is able to call the President, and that's
24 a valuable thing if you want to try to move our U.S.-Ukraine
25 relations along.	So, at the beginning, it was not a problem.

110


Q	How long have you known Ambassador Volker for?
2 A	So probably 20 years.	A long time.
3 Q	And is he a man of integrity?
4 A	He is a man of integrity.
5 Q	And he is somebody that's always, to the best of
6 your knowledge, acted in the best interests of the United
7 States?
8 A	He -- when he got involved with Mr. Giuliani, I

9 think tha t that pulled him away from or it diverted him from
10 being focused on what I thought needed to be focused on, that
II is -- yeah.	So, in general, yes, but the Giuliani factor I
12 think affected Ambassador Volker.
13 Q	But as a man of integrity, if he genuinely believed
14 it was in the best interests of the Uni ted States to engage
15 wi th Giuliani, do you agree that that's	he was acting in

16the besti nte rests of the United States when he did that?17AI think he though t he was.18QTher e's this May 23rd bri efi ng in the Oval19Office20AYes.21Qwhere the delegation that went to the22inaugural23AYes.24Q-- communi cated with the President.25AYes.



111


Q	We've had some accounts of that meeting.
2 A	I'm sure.
3 Q	And Ambassador Volker was there.	Obviously, we've
4 talked to him at some length.	Ambassador Sondland.	And
5 characterizations of that meeting have differed sometimes
6 between the actual participants and those reporting on what
7 they think had occurred.
8 For example, i t's been	you know, the President has
9 been characterized or has been quoted as saying, "Work with
10 Rudy."	Is that something you heard?
I I	A	Yes.
12 Q	Okay.	And then it's also been related to us that
13 the President said, "Talk to Rudy, " and it's in a dismissive
14 sort of way.	You know, the President had his concerns about
15 corruption in Ukraine and, you know, a laundry list of
16 reasons, including the fact that the President believed that
17 there were Ukrainians trying to work against him in the
18 election, right?


19 A

As we established, some Ukrainians, a couple of

20 Ukrainians.	And the important point here is none of those,
21 with the exception of Avakov, who is still -- none of those
22 were in or are in the Zelensky administration.
23 So that's what -- as I understand it, that's what
24 Ambassador Volker, Sondland, Perry were coming back to tell
25 President Trump, that, you know, we just met President

112


Zelensky, and he supports what you support.	I've heard
2 several people said -- made -- tried to make that point.
3 Q	And the participants of the meeting have told us
4 that they briefed the President, and the President wasn't
5 having it.
6 A	Right.
7 Q	He said negative thi ngs about the country of
8 Ukraine.
9 A	I've heard that.
IO	Q	And he didn't, you know, get into specifics.	He
II simply said:	It's been related to us, talk to Rudy.	If you
12 thi nk Ukraine is doing such -- you know, they've turned the
13 corner and Zelensky is the reformer he says he's going to be,
14 you know, talk to Rudy.
15 Is that fair?
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	If I could just interject, and I have to
17 make this advisory periodically.	What counsel represents
18 prior witnesses may have said or not said, we cannot vouch
19 for the accuracy.
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Okay.
21 THE CHAIRMAN:	Unless you are a percipient witness, you
22 should not assume facts that are not in evidence before you.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
24 BY MR. CASTOR:
25 Q	You know, there's nuances that we aren't aware of,

113


you know, that occur in these meetings.	There's ambiguities,
2 and in the, you know, ambiguity a lot of times people jump to
3 conclusions.	And so the question is, is there a difference
4 between talk to Rudy and work with Rudy?
5 A	I don' t know.
6 Q	Okay.
7 A	I don't know.
8 Q	And was that related to you by Ambassador Sondland
9 or Volker?

IO	A
I I	Q
12 A
13 Q

The difference between those two? Yes.
No.
Or what had to be effectuated with Mr. Giuliani?

14 A	Here's what I understood from Ambassador Volker and
15 Ambassador Sondland.	In order to get President Zelensky and
16 President Trump in a meeting in the Oval Office, they took
17 from that May 23rd meeting that they needed to work with Rudy
18 Giuliani, so -- and so they did.
19 Q	What did Volker relate to you about next steps
20 then?	You said you talk with Volker a lot, right?
21 A	I do.
22 Q	And what did he -- do you remember some of the blow
23 by blow, the play by --
24 A	Well, no, actually, he didn't tell me anything
25 about him reaching out to Giuliani.	And about the same time

1 1 4


he had his breakfast with Giuliani, he mentioned that I think
2 in a text to me and Gordon.	And about that same time, Fiona
3 Hill, Dr. Hill mentioned that same thi ng, that she had heard
4 that Kurt had been in touch with or met with Rudy Gi uli ani.
5 That was -- I think that was the first time I was aware that
6 Kurt had been i n touch with Giu li ani along these lines.
7 Q	Did Ambassador Volker give you any readout of his
8 conversations or what he was doing?
9 A	He didn't.
10 Q	Okay.	So he di dn' t tell you that he told Mr.
11 Gi uli an i that ther e was no good-faith basis to investigate
12 the Bidens?
13 A	He di dn' t tell me anythi ng about his conversat i on
14 with Gi uli an i .
15 Q	Did you ever come to learn from Sandland or other
16 players that that was the case?
17 A	No.	That was the case between Volker and Giuliani?
18 Q	Correct.
19 A	No.
20 Q	Would that surprise you if Volker had communicated
21 that to Giuliani?
22 A	Communicated what?
23 Q	That there is no good faith basis to inv esti gate
24 the Bi dens.
25 A	No knowledge.	I can't answer.




115



MR. CASTOR:	I have about 8 or 9 minutes left and I
2 promised our members we would pivot to them at the end of
3 the -- at the end of our round, so I would like to do that.
4 MR. NUNES:	Thank you, Mr. Castor.
5 Ambassador, welcome.	You're aware that this committee
6 had an investigation into the 2016 elections, the House
7 Intelligence Committee?
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Am I aware that there is one?	Yes.
9 MR. NUNES:	Yes, that there was one that completed, and
10 now those i nvesti gati ons have even continued.
II AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know much about it, Mr.
12 Chairman, but -- Mr. Nunes, but --
13 MR. NUNES:	You're also aware that -- you' re aware of
14 the Bob Mueller special counsel investigation
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am aware.
16 MR. NUNES:	-- of the 2016 elections.
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am.
18 MR. NUNES:	You may not be aware, but at least the
19 Republicans on this committee were very concerned by
20 Ukraine's actions during the 2016 election, and they have
21 long been a target of our investigation and have conti nued
22 today to try to get to the bottom of what they were up to in
23 the 2016 election between the Ambassador's comments here and
24 between other incidents that are out there.
25 Most notably, are you familiar with -- well, I know





116



you're familiar because you talked about Leschenko earlier --
2 former journali st turned politician
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Leschenko, yes.
4 MR. NUNES:	Do you have any current involvement with
5 Leschenko?	Do you run into him now or you're just familiar
6 with him?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm familiar with him.	I think I
8 met him in my -- in the 2006-2009 time period, or maybe it
9 was an earlier visit in like 2014.	But he's not in the
10 governm en.t now, and he's not in the Parliament now, I'm
11 pretty sure.
12 MR. NUNES:	Okay.	So he's of particular interest to at
13 least the Republicans in Congress.	Are you aware that he was
14 a source for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign's dirt
15 that they dug up on the President and fed to the FBI?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am not aware.
17 MR. NUNES:	Okay.	So I didn't think you were aware of
18 that, but I wanted to make sure you knew that he is -- by
19 witnesses who have testified before this committee, he's the
20 source of that dirt that was then used -- you're familiar
21 with -- you've heard of the Steele dossier, I assume?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I have.
23 MR. NUNES:	Okay.	So that is our real concern in
24 Ukraine over the 2016 election.	So I understand that you, as
25 an Ambassador, you don't like to get involved in politics,

11 7



but the fact of the matter is the Ukrainians decided to get
2 involved in politics and be, in almost all cases, supportive
3 of the Democrats and helped to deliver dirt that was then
4 used by the --
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Nunes, the only comment I would
6 make on that is that, again, according to this Politico
7 document, which is similar to what you' re describing, there
8 were a couple of Ukrainians who did what you said.
9 When you say "Ukrainian s," that paints a broad brush.
10 And President -- the reason I raise this is that President
II	Zelensky wants to make it very clear to us and to President
12 Trump that it wasn't him and it wasn't his people.
13 MR. NUNES:	Right.	But at the time of the -- at the
14 time when Mr. Giuliani and Republicans in Congress are
15 raising these concerns about what was happening in Ukraine,
16 you know, that's when the Muell er investigation is still
17 ongoing, our probe is still ongoing, looking into getting to
18 the bottom of FISA abuse and other matters.
19 So I know you don't want to get involved in politics,
20 but those are still just ongoing concerns of the Congress.
21 Thank you for your attendance today.
22 I' ll yi eld to Mr. J ordan.
23 MR. J ORDAN:	Real quick if I could, Ambassador, on that
24 last point.	President Zelensky does want to clean up
25 corruption.	You know, he's been viewed as a reformer, but I

118



think you said earlier to Mr. Castor's questions that
2 Mr. Avakov is still in the government.	Is that right?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct.
4 MR. JORDAN:	And he has a pretty important position?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He does.
6 MR. JORDAN:	And he's the guy who said that President
7 Trump, during the 2016 campaign, was -- I think he referred
8 to him in social media postings as a clown and as worse than
9 a terrorist.	Is that accurate?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Is that what -- is that the quote
II	out of this Politico document?
12 MR. JORDAN:	It i s.
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes.
14 MR. JORDAN:	And he's currently in the government,
15 Minister of Interior, in charge of the police in Ukraine.	Is
16 that right?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He is.	He is.	I suspect he would
18 not say the same thing today that he said then.
19 MR. JORDAN:	No, I understand that, but I just want to
20 be clear.
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	But 2016.
22 MR. J ORDAN:	All right.	Thank you.
23 Mr. Ratcliffe has a couple.
24 MR. RATCLIFFE:	Ambassador Taylor, my name is John
25 Ratcliffe.

119



I want to read from -- di rect you to your opening
2 statement this morning, page 9, the bottom paragraph, and it
3 reads:	"Just days later, on August 27, Ambassador Bolton
4 arrived in Kyiv and met with President Zelensky.	During
5 their meeti ng" --
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, can I get you to hold
7 on?	I'm looking at a different one.	Yeah, thank you.
8 MR. RATCLIFFE:	Last paragraph, page 9.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, got it.	Okay, met wi th.	Yes.
10 MR. RATCLIFFE:	"Du r i ng thei r meeti ng, sec uri ty
II	assistance was not discussed -- amazingly, news of the hold
12 did not leak out until August 29.	I, on the other hand, was
13 all too aware of and still troubled by the hold."
14 Have I read tha t correctly?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes, sir.
16 MR. RATCLIFFE:	Okay.	It sounds like, from your
17 statement today, tha t you were aware of the hold and troubled
18 by it but that President Zelensky was not aware of i t at that
19 point in ti me.

20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is corr ect.
21 MR. RATCLIFFE:	0kay.	So, based on your knowledge ,
22 nobody in the Ukrainian Government became aware of a hold on
23 mi li tary aid until 2 days later, on August 29th.
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's my understanding.
25 MR. RATCLIFFE:	That's your understanding.	And that

120



would have been well over a month after the Ju ly 25th call
2 between President Trump and President Zelensky.
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
4 MR. RATCLIFFE:	So you're not a lawyer, are you.
5 Ambassador Taylor?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am not.
7 MR. RATCLIFFE:	0kay.	So the i dea of a q ui d pro quo i s
8 it's a concept where there is a demand for action or an
9 attempt to influence action in exchange for something else. IO		And i n this case, when people are talking about a quid pro II	quo, that something else is military aid.
12 So, if nobody in the Ukrainian Government is aware of a
13 military hold at the time of the Trump-Zelensky call, then,
14 as a matter of law and as a matter of fact, there can be no
15 quid pro quo, based on military aid.	I just want to be real
16 clear that, again, as of July 25th, you have no knowledge of
17 a quid pro quo i nvolvi ng military aid.
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	July 25th is a week after the hold
19 was put on the security assistance.	And July 25th, they had
20 a conversation between the two Presidents, where it was not
21 discussed.
22 MR. RATCLIFFE:	And to your knowledge, nobody in the
23 Ukrainian Government was aware of the hold?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct.
25 MR. RATCLIFFE:	Great.	Thank you for clarifying.

121


I yield back..
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	The time of the minority has
3 expired.
4 Let's break for lunch until 1:30.	I want to remind
5 members they are not to discuss the substance of the
6 Ambassador's testimony.	And we will resume at 1:30.

[1:56 p.m.]
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	We're back on the record.
3 Ambassador, I wanted to just ask you a few followup
4 questions to the questions you received from the minority,
5 and then I want to go through some of your opening statement.
6 Then I'll hand it over to Mr. Noble, who will go much more
7 methodically than I will through your testimony and the
8 timeline.
9 You were asked by my colleagues in the minority doesn' t
10 the U.S. have a legitimate interest in fighting corrupti on,
11 and I think you would agree that we do.	Is that right?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct, Chairman.
13 THE CHAIRMAN:	And in fact, Ambassador Yovanovitch was
14 doing exactly that.	She was urging the Ukrainians at every
15 opportunity to fight corrup ti on that had plagued Ukraine.
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes, sir.
17 THE CHAIRMAN:	And it came to your attention that part
18 of the reason why people in Ukraine and maybe some in the
19 horn ets' nest or vip ers' nest in the United States wanted her
20 out was that her efforts to fight corruption were getti ng in
21 the way of some potentially corrupt business deals they

22 wanted to make happen.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:

Is that a fair summary?
That could be the case.	I don' t

24 know the direct links there, but there were people who were
25 concerned that she was so tough on -- it would be hard for




123



them to do the kinds of deals that they wanted to do.
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	Because she was fighting corruption in
3 Ukraine?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, yes, and supporting reformers
5 or other people in the government who were fighting
6 corruption in Ukraine.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	And you can distinguish, can't you,
8 between a legitimate interest in getting a country to fight
9 corruption and an illegitimate interest in getting a foreign
10 government to interfere in U.S. Presidential elections?
II	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	There is a difference.
12 THE CHAIRMA N:	And wouldn't you say that trying to get a
13 foreign country to intervene in a U.S. Presidential election
14 is not fighting corruption, it is in itself corruption?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Chairman, you're taking me
16 beyond my area of expertise.	Just the facts are what I can
17 attest to, but the -- what I said earlier about institutions
18 I think is -- the way to fight corruption is to fix the
19 courts and fix the judges.
20 So it's an institutional rather than, as you point out,
21 rather than individual cases, which may or may not get us to
22 a reformed, less corrupt system.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	And one of the concerns you had, though,
24 was that there were efforts being made through this irregular
25 channel to get Ukraine to interfere in U.S. politics and the

124


next election, is that right?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The irregular channel seemed to
3 focus on specific issues, specific cases, rather than the
4 regular channel's focus on institution building.	So the
5 irregular channel, I thi nk under the influence of Mr.
6 Giuliani, wanted to focus on one or two specific cases,
7 irrespective of whether it helped solve the corruption
8 problem, fight the corruption problem.
9 THE CHAIRMAN:	And those two cases you mentioned, the
10 Burisma and the Bidens and the 2016 election, those were both
II	in di vidual	investigations that were sought by Mr. Giuliani
12 because he believed it would help his client, the President
13 of the United States, right?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's my understanding.
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	Let me go through -- I want to ask you
16 about the Politico article which minority counsel spent about
17 a thir d of their time asking you about this article.	Prior
18 to today, had you ever read this article?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I had not.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	Are you able to confirm in any way any of
21 the allegat i ons in the article?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned to Mr.
23 Castor, I was surprised and disappointed to read what these
24 Ukrainians were reported to have said and done.
25 THE CHAIRMAN:	But you're not in a position to confirm

125



or deny whether the article is right, not right, half right,
2 or anything of the sort?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.
4 THE CHAIRMA N:	And this article didn't affect your
5 decision-making at any time, because you were unaware of it?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I was unaware of it.	It was 2 years
7 ago.
8 THE CHAIRMA N:	There are at least a couple issues that
9 have been raised by your testimony.	The first involves
10 conditionality surroundi ng the desperately sought meeting
I I	between the two Presidents, desperately sought by the
12 Ukrainians, that is.
13 And the second involves condi ti onali ty around mi li tary
14 aid.	So let me go through your testimony, if I could, and
15 ask you about a few of those -- both of those issues.
16 On page 5 of your testi mony, in the third paragraph, you
17 say:	"But during my subsequent communications with
18 Ambassador Volker and Sondland, they relayed to me that the
19 President, quo te, "wan ted to hear from Zelensky," unquote,
20 before scheduling the meeting in the Oval Office.	It was not
21 clear to me what this meant.
22 Now, I take it, Ambassador, you used that word "before"
23 deli berately, that is, they wanted to hear from Zelensky
24 before they would schedule this meeting.	Is tha t right?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct.





1 26



THE CHAIRMAN:	Now, at the time I think you said it
2 wasn't clear to you what this meant.
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is also correct.
4 THE CHAIRMAN:	And in the two paragraphs below, you say:
5 "I sensed something odd when Ambassador Sandland told me on
6	June 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular
7 interagency participants in the call planned with President
8 Zelensky later that day."
9 Why did you sense something odd about that?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He and I were on the phone talking II	about the timing of this call.	This call had been set up.
12 Obviously, when you're trying to get the head of state on a
13 call, get President Zelensky on a call, you had to work
14 through the timing.	Was it convenient?	Could he -- there
15	may have had to be interpreters present.	He had to be at the
16 right phone.	So we were working on when the meeting would
17 happen.
18 On the phone , Ambassador Sandland told me that the
19 timing was going to change, that the time of the phone call
20 was going to change.	And I asked him something like,
21 shouldn' t we let everybody else know who's supposed to be on
22 this call?	And the answer was, don't worry about it.	Even
23 his staff, I thi nk, were not aware that the time had changed.
24
25

127



[2:02 p.m.]
2 THE CHAIRMA N:	And what was odd to you about that?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thi s suggested to me tha t ther e were
4 the two channels.	This suggested to me that the norma l
5 channel, where you would have staff on the phone call, was
6 being cut out, and the other channel, of people who were
7 working, again, toward a goal which I supported, which was
8 having a meet i ng to further U.S.-Ukra i ni an relations, I
9 suppor ted, but that irregular channel di dn't have a respect
10 for or an interest in having the normal staff part i ci pate in
II this call with the head of state.
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	So was thi s an early indication to you
13 that these two channels were diverging?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It was.
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	And the interests of the irregular
16 channel, represented by Mr. Giuliani. may not be the same
17 interests as the State Department and what was in the best
18 interest of the United States?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: That second part I came to believe.
20 I'm not sure it was at this point.	This is within a week, a
21 week and a half, of me -- 10 days of me arriving there.	And
22 so I was sti ll, maybe nai vely, but I was sti ll of the view
23 that I was on -- I was part of a team that might have several
24 parts but we were movi ng in the same direction.
25 So i t was not -- I think, Mr. Chairman, it was not yet.

128



That would come.
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	But Ambassador Sondland made it clear not
3 only that he di dn' t wish to include most of the regular
4 interagency participants but also that no one was
5 transcribing or monitoring the call as they added Presi dent
6 Zelensky.	What struck you as odd about that?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Same concern.	That is, in the
8 normal, regular channel, the State Department operations
9 center that was putting the call together would stay on the
10 li ne, in particular when you were having a conversation with II		the head of state, they would stay on the line, tran scrib e,
12 take notes so that there could be a record of the discussion
13 with this head of state.	It is an official discussion.
14 When he wanted to be sure that there was not , the State
15 Department operations center agreed.	And they told us, they
16 said -- in response to his request, they said, we won't
17 monitor and will not -- and we certainly won't tran scrib e
18 because we're going to sign off.
19 THE CHAIRMAN:	On the followi ng page of your testimony,
20 page 6, second paragraph, you testified:	"By mid-July i t was
21 becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky
22 wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and
23 alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.
24 It was also clear that this condition was driven by the
25 irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided

129


by Mr. Giuliani."
2 How had that become clear to you by mid-July?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: In the subsequent paragraphs,
4 Mr. Chairman, I tried to walk through that conclusion, how I
5 came to that conclusion.
6 THE CHAIRMAN:	And when you -- I'll go through that with
7 you.	But when you say "conditioned on the investigations," I
8 take it by that you mean, unless President Zelensky would
9 agree to do these investigations of Burisma, meaning the
10 Bidens, and Ukrainian interference in 2016, he wasn' t going
11 to get the White House meeting.	Is that right?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: That is corr ect.	Mr. Yermak,
13 President Zelensky's assistant, came back at one point	I
14 think I talk about it in here -- and asked to nail down a
15 date first and then he would make the statement	he would
16 make the statement of the investigations.
17 You know, Kurt and Ambassador Sondland did not -
18 weren't able to make that offer, weren't able to nail down
19 the date.	But the point is, that was -- they saw that that
20 was the condition.
21 THE CHAIRMAN:	And, in fact, later on, they would insist
22 that President Zelensky speak first.	That is, until you say
23 publicly you're going to do these two investigations we want
24 for the President, you're not going to get that meeting.
25 That was essentially the position that this irregular channel





130


took.
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	Now, my colleague in the minority asked
4 you about "qui d pro quo."	And are you a lawyer?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am not.	I am not, Mr. Chairman.
6 THE CHAIRMAN:	Because he asked you about the legal
7 definition of "quid pro quo."	So you're not in a position to
8 talk about legal definitions?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am definitely not in the position.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.
I I	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I don't speak Latin.
12 THE CHAIRMA N:	And, of course, whether it meets a legal
13 definition of "quid pro quo" or i t doesn't is really
14 irrelevant to what we're focused on here.
15 But it is your testimony that, hey, you don't make these
16 pub li c statements about these two poli ti cal investigations we
17 want, you're not getting this meeting -- you make these
18 statements, you'll get the meeting; you don't make these
19 statements, you won't.	Was that your understanding of the
20 state of affairs in July of 2019?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
22 THE CHAIRMAN:	Further down on page 6 of your testimony,
23 second- to-last paragraph, at the end of that paragraph, you
24 state:	"All that the 0MB staff person" -- now we're talking
25 about the military assistance.




131



AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Right.
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	"All that the 0MB staff person said was
3 that the directive had come from the President to the Chief
4 of Staff to OMB."
5 That is the directive not to provide the military
6 assistance, or to hold it up.	Is that right?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
8 THE CHAIRMAN:	"In an instant, I realized that one of
9 the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was
10 threatened.	The irregular policy channel was running
II contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. poli cy."
12 What did you mean by that?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Longstanding goal of U.S. policy
14 would be to support Ukraine in its attempt to defend itself
15 against the Russians.	Part of that was security assistance.
16 Security assistance had been very effective.	It was weapons,
17 it was training, it was the communications equipment, it was
18 sustainables.	It allowed Ukrainian soldiers to actually
19 defend themselves.
20 That was longstanding U.S. policy.	Even in the previous
21 administration, the previous administration did not provide
22 lethal weapons, but they did provide all this other	so
23 that was longstanding policy.	To stop it, to hold it, for no
24 apparent reason that I could see, was undercutting the
25 longstanding U.S. policy.





132



THE CHAIRMAN:	In the last paragraph on page 6, you say:
2 "There followed a series of NSC-led interagency meetings,
3 starting at the staff lev el and qu i ckly reaching the level of
4 Cabi net secretari es. At every meeti ng, the unanimous
5 concl usi on was that the security assistance should be
6 resumed, the hold li fted."
7 I take it by that there was no dissent, no disagreement
8 with that.	Everyone thought that, from the point of view of
9 U.S. nati onal security and our ally fighting the Russians,
10 that security assistance should be resumed without delay.
II	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Unanimous opinion of every level of
12 interagency discussion.
13 THE CHAIRMAN :	Was that i t should resume without delay?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Wi thout delay.
15 THE CHAIRMA N:	And you go on i n that paragraph to say:
16 "My understanding was that the Secretaries of Defense and
17 State, the CIA Director, and the Nati onal Security Advisor
18 sought a joint meeting with the Presi dent to convince him to
19 release the hold, but such a meeting was hard to schedule."
20 What do you deduce from that, that our ally is fighting
21 with the Russians, but all of these agencies that support
22 this can't get a meeting with the President to discuss it?
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It turns out, Mr. Chairman, that
24 those principals, as we call them, were on d i fferent trips at
25 different times.	I think thi s was also about the time of the




133



Greenland question, about purchasing Greenland, which took up
2 a lot of energy in the NSC.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	That's disturbing for a whole
4 different reason.
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Different story.	Different story.
6 But, no, the general point was, it was a scheduling
7 issue, because they really wanted Secretary Esper to be
8 there, for obvious reasons.	Most of this assistance came
9 through the Defense Department, and they wanted him to be
10 there.	He was traveling.	There may have been an Afghanistan
II	trip.	I can't remember whether -- but the problem was
12 getting the right people in the room at the same time.
13 There actually was a meeting on Afghanistan where all of
14 the principals hoped to raise the Ukraine issue at the end of
15 the Afghanistan meeting.	Didn't happen.
16 All to say that there was a strong interest in hav i ng
17 this meeting with the President to try to change the
18 position.
19 THE CHAIRMAN:	You go on to say, a couple paragraphs
20 later, "In the same July 19	phone cal1,	they gave me an
21 account of the July 10 meeting with the Ukrainian officials
22 at the White House.	Specifically, they told me" -- and
23 you're referring to Dr. Hill and Mr. Vindman, I believe
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
25 THE CHAIRMAN:	-- "tha t Ambassador Sondland had

134


connected 'investigations' with an Oval Office meeting for
2 Presi den t Zelensky, which so irritated Ambassador Bolton that
3 he abruptly ended the meeting, telling Dr. Hill and
4 Mr. Vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic
5 politics. 11
6 Again, is this going to the conditionality of Ukraine
7 having to do these investigations if they wanted the Oval
8 Office meeting?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: That was the implication of that
10 connection, of the connection between the meeting and
11 i nves ti gati ons.
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	You go on to say, in the second-to-last
13 paragraph, "Also during our July 19	call, Dr. Hill informed
14 me tha t Ambassador Volker had met with Mr. Giuliani to
15 discuss Ukraine.	This caught me by surprise.	The next day I
16 asked Ambassador Volker about that meeting, but recei ved no
17 response. 11
18 How did you ask him about the meeting?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	By text message.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	And had he been pretty good about
21 replyi ng to you in the past?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Pretty good, but, again, he's also
23 on the road a lot.	And sometimes he's in an airplane.
24 Sometimes I'll get a message back.	Most times I get a
25 message back, but not all the time.




135



THE CHAIRMAN:	In this case, you got no reply at all, no
2 matter when he got off an airplane or whatever took place
3 thereafter?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don' t remember getting a response.
5 I think, at the same time, that was when I heard from
6 Dr. Hill that Ambassador Volker had had a meeting with
7 Mr. Giuliani, so that I got both bits of information the same
8 time on, I think, the same meeting.
9 THE CHAIRMAN:	Turning to page 8 of your testimony:
10 "Also on July 20, I had a phone conversation with
II	Mr. Danyliuk, during which he conveyed to me that President
12 Zelensky did not want to be used as a pawn in a
13 U.S. re-election campa i gn."
14 Do you remember what Mr. Danyliuk said and why he was
15 concerned he was being used as a pawn or why President
16 Zelensky was concerned he was being used as a pawn in a
17 U.S. reelection campaign?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	I think it was becoming clear
19 to the Ukrainians that, in order to get this meeting that
20 they wanted, they would have to commit to pursuing these
21 investigations.	And Mr. Danyliuk, at least, understood --
22 and I'm sure that he briefed President Zelensky, I'm sure
23 they had this conversation -- believed that opening those
24 investigations, in particular on Burisma, would have involved
25 Ukraine in the 2020 election campaign.	He did not want to do

136

2
that .
THE CHAIRMAN:	Turn i ng to page 9 of your testimony,3second paragraph, about midway through:	"A formal4U.S. request to the Ukrainians to conduct an investigation5based on violations of their own law struck me as improper,6and I recommended to Ambassador Volker that we 'stay clear.'"7What struck you as improper about it?8AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It struck me as improper that the9United States would be asking -- if the United States were to10ask Ukraine to investigate an apparent violation of Ukrainian11law, that would be improper.12If, on the other hand -- what is proper and what happens13frequently is the United States goes to Ukraine and asks for14their help to pursue an investigation of violations of15American law, of U.S. law.	That's what we have a mutual16legal assistance treaty, an MLAT, for.17But this is different.	Thi s would be -- what Kurt was18asking for was examples or precedent for asking the19Ukrainians to investigate a violation of their own law.20THE CHAIRMAN:	Well, there were two things that were21improper about this, weren't there?	There was the one you're22mentioning now, which is that it wasn't appropriate to ask23Ukraine to investigate a violation of Ukrainian law, cor rect?24AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.25THE CHAIRMA N:	But it was also improper because the goal

13 7



of those investigations was to influence the U.S. election.
2 Isn't that also the case?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
4 THE CHAIRMAN:	If you could turn to page 10 of your
5 written testimony.
6 One of my colleagues in the minority asked you about,
7 well, how could it be a quid pro quo if the Ukrainians di dn' t
8 know that security assistance was withheld.	But Ukraine
9 found out it was being withheld, did they not?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	They did.
11 THE CHAIRMAN:	And once they found out it was being
12 withheld -- in the second paragraph of page 10 of your
13 testimony, you state:	"The same day that I sent my cable to
14 the Secretary, August 29, Mr. Yermak contacted me and was
15 very concerned, asking about the withheld security
16 assistance.	The hold that the White House had placed on the
17 assistance had just been made public that day in a Politico
18 story.	At that point, I was embarrassed that I could give
19 him no explanation for why it was wi thheld ."
20 Why were you embarrassed by that?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I was embarrassed because the United
22 States, as the principal ally, the principal supporter for
23 Ukraine, in general, but in particular in its fight with the
24 Russians, was seen to be	they found out that we had put a
25 hold on the assistance that would help them fight the

138


Russians.	And, at that point, I had nothing to tell them.
2 I mean, the obvious question was, "Why?"	So Mr. Yermak
3 and others were trying to figure out why this was, and they
4 thought maybe, if they were to travel, if Mr. Yermak were to
5 go to Washington to talk to someone here or -- the Defense
6 Minister also contacted me later on.	He wanted the same
7 thing.
8 They thought that there must be some rational reason for
9 this being held up , and they just di dn't -- and maybe in
10 Washington they di dn't understand how important this
11 assistance was to their fight and to their armed fo rces.	And
12 so maybe they could figure	so they were just desperate.
13 And I couldn't tell them.	I di dn' t know and I didn't tell
14 them, because we hadn't -- we hadn 't -- there'd been no
15 guidance that I could give them.
16 THE CHAIRMA N:	And was it your suspicion at this point
17 already that the assistance was being withheld potentially
18 because of this help they wanted to get from the Ukrainians
19 first?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	You know, Mr. Chairman, same kind of
21 question about how it dawns on you.	My next paragraph said
22 it had not occurred to me that the hold on security
23 assistance could be related to the investigations.	As of
24 that time, it hadn't.	I hadn't put those dots together.	I
25 hadn't connected those dots.

139



The next couple -- the next week, from the discussion on
2 Sept mber 1st through about September 7th, it became clearer.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	So when you're asked about this by
4 Mr. Yermak on August 29th, you' re embarrassed because you
5 hadn't been able to get an answer as to why the aid was
6 withheld and you felt it desperately ought to be provided.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm a representative of the United
8 States Government out there, and he asked me a perfectly
9 legitimate question, why are you holding up this assistance,
IO	and I couldn't tell him.
11 THE CHAIRMAN:	Now, at this point, when you couldn't
12 tell them, they were aware of other asks the President had
13 made in that call, right?	You know that now, although you
14 didn't at the time.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	On - - correct, on the meeting.
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	And even though the Ukrainians learned on
17	August 29th that there had been a hold plac ed, they certainly
18 knew up through this whole period of June, Ju ly, August that
19 they hadn't yet received the aid, ri ght?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The aid -- so, right.	The aid had,
21 by and large, not been put out to contra ct.
22 It's 1-year money, by the way.	If we can make it 2-year
23 money, that would be great.	This is a li ttle plug here for
24 2-year money.
25 But it was 1-year money.	It expired on the 30th of

140



September.	And it was late in coming in the fiscal year, and
2 so it had not been obligated.	It hadn't been put into
3 contracts yet.	So, right, they -- I don't think they
4 suspected anything during that time.
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	Yeah.	But you said, in the middle of
6 page 10, "It had still not occurred to me that the hold on
7 security assistance could be related to the 'investigations.'
8 That, however, would soon change."
9 So let me ask you about when that began to change.
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.
11 THE CHAIRMAN:	In the middle of the following paragraph,
12 you testify, "Indeed, I received a readout of the
13 Pence-Zelensky meeti ng" -- that would be the meeting in
14 Poland.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	On the 1st of September.
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	On the 1st of September.	You received a
17 readout "over the phone from Mr. Morrison, during which he
18 told me President Zelensky had opened the meeting by asking
19 the Vice President about security cooperation."
20 So this was -- if he opened the meeting with this, this
21 was foremost on President Zelensky's mind?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes, sir.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	Now, the final paragraph on page 10:
24 "Duri ng this same phone call I had with Mr . Morrison, he went
25 on to describe a conversation Ambassador Sandland had with

141



Mr. Yermak at Warsaw.	Ambassador Sandland told Mr. Yermak
2 that the security assistance money would not come until
3 President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma
4 i nvest i gati on."	And the Burisma investigation, again, is the
5 one involving the Bidens.
6 Now, again, I want to ask you about conditionality.	If
7 Mr. Morrison told you that, according to Mr. Sandland, that
8 Mr. Sandland had communicated to the Ukrainians, to
9 Mr. Yermak, security assistance money would not come until
10 President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma
II	i nve sti gat i on, the one is being conditioned on the other, is
12 it not?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
14 THE CHAIRMAN:	You go on, at the end of that paragraph,
15 top of page 11:	"This was the first time I had heard that
16 the security assistance -- not just the White House
17 meeting -- was conditioned on the i nvesti gati ons."
18 So both of these things you now had learned were
19 conditioned on these two political investigations, right?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct, sir.
21 THE CHAIRMAN:	That is, but for the Ukrainians'
22 willingness to do these two investigations, they were not
23 only not going to get the White House meeting, they were also
24 not going to get the military assistance.
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is what Mr. Sandland told

1 42



Mr. Yermak.
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	So that is what's communicated by the
3 U.S. Ambassador to the EU, charged with a Ukrainian
4 responsibility to the Ukrainians, about what they have to do
5 if they want to get the White House meeting and U.S. military
6 assistance.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The only qualification I would put
8 on that is that Ambassador Sondland was not the principal
9 United States representative to Ukraine.	Ukraine's not in
IO	the EU.	He had this irregular, informal commi ssi on from
II	President Trump based on May 23rd.
12	THE CHAIRMAN:	But this is someone, an ambassador -- 13	 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Ambassador.
14 THE CHAIRMAN:	-- high rank
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes.
16 THE CHAIRMA N:	-- having direct communication with the
17 President --
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He had direct communication with the
19 Presi dent , yes.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	-- and he is communicating to the
21 Ukrainians that if they don't do these political
22 investigations tha t would help Mr. Trump in the next
23 election, they won't get the meeting with the President and
24 they won't get military assistance.	Is that correct?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That' s corr ect.

143



THE CHAIRMAN:	If I can go to the second full paragraph
2 on page 11 of your testimony.
3 "Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized
4 that he had made a mi stake by earli er telling the Ukrainian
5 off i ci als to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with
6 President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of
7 investigations - - in fact, Ambassador Sondland said,
8 'every thi ng' was dependent on such an announcement, i nclud i ng
9 security assistance."
10 Meaning that he had understated the matter before.	Am I
II	right?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He thought it would -- he realized
13 that it had been a mistake to condition it only on the
14 meeting.
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	That it was also -- the military
16 assi stance was also going to be conditioned on the commi tment
17 by Ukraine to do these two political investigations.
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
19 THE CHAIRMAN:	You go on to say in that paragraph, "He
20 said"	he, Ambassador Sondland	"said that President
21 Trump wanted President Zelensky 'in a public box' by making a
22 public statement about ordering such i nvesti gati ons."
23 By that, do you mean, Ambassador, that President Trump
24 wanted Zelensky to have to make a public commitment, to get
25 in to a publi c box -- tha t is, commit publi cly to these two

144


i nvesti gati ons -- before he was going to get either the
2 meeting or the assistance?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's what Ambassador Sandland told
4 me.
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	So it wasn't even enough that they make a
6 private commitment; Ambassador Sandland was saying that
7 Ukraine and President Zelensky needed to make a public
8 statement for the President.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	In the next paragraph, you say, "In the
11 same September 1 cal1,	I told Ambassador Sandland that
12 President Tru mp should have more respect for another head of
13 state and that what he described was not in the i nteres t of
14 ei ther President Trump or President Zelensky."
15 What did you mean that he should have more respect for
16 another head of state?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	What Ambassador Sandland was telling
18 me that President Tru mp wanted, and, again, presumably based
19 on a phone call between Ambassador Sandland and President
20 Trump, was that President Trump wanted a public statement
21 from Presi den t Zelensky.	And that struck me to be bad for
22 both, that it would not turn out well for both.
23 But, in answer to your question, Mr. Chairman, that
24 would show disrespect to another head of state.	If Presi dent
25 Trump is telling you, I want you to go out and publicly say

145



you're going to do this, that was disrespectful, in my view,
2 to another head of state.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	Disrespectful in the sense that he not
4 only wanted this illicit bargain but he wanted him to make it
5 public that he was going to -- in other words, that he
6 couldn' t trust the Ukrainian President to honor a private
7 commitment to do these two political investigations, he
8 needed it to be public?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Chairman, I didn't go that far.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	Yeah.
11 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I mean, that was not in my mind,
12 about public/private.	It was more the direction from one
13 President to another President.	Two sovereign states having
14 a conversation, a respectful conver sati on, you would not have
15 one telling the other to go out and make a public --
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	In the next paragraph -- well, let me
17 turn to the following page, page 12, of your testimony.
18 The second- to-la st paragraph, in the middle of the
19 paragraph, you testify:	"Ambassador Sondland said that he
20 talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and told them
21 that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President
22 Zelensky did not 'clear things up' in public, we would be at
23 a 'stalemate.'	I understood a 'stalemate' to mean that
24 Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military
25 assi stance."





146



So you understood that, unless President Zelensky made
2 this public statement, they weren't going to get the military
3 assistance.
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	On page 13, the middle paragraph, you're
6 talk i ng about the text messages, and you testified:	"Before
7 these text messages, during our call on September 8,
8 Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President
9 Trump is a businessman.	When a bus i nessman is about to sign
10 a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the
II	businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the
12 check."
13 Now, when Ambassador Sondland described to you this
14 signing of the check, did you take it by that he was
15 referring to signing the check for the military assistance?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes.
17 THE CHAIRMAN:	You go on in the next sentence to say,
18 "Ambassador Volker used the same terms several days later
19 when we were together at the Yalta European Strategy
20 Conference."
2 1	Did he use the same "si gni ng the check" term?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	Did that strike you as remarkable, that
24 that same analogy was used by both ambassadors?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No.	It struck me -- I concluded

147



that they had had a conversati on.
2 THE CHAIRMA N:	And that they both understood that if
3 President Trump was going to sign the check for military
4 assistance then they needed to pay up first and that pay-up
5 was a public declaration of these two political
6 investigations?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That was the parallel.
8 THE CHAIRMAN:	You go on to say, "I argued to both that
9 the explanation made no sense: the Ukrainians did not 'owe'
10 President Trump anything , and holding up security assistance
II	for domestic political gain was 'cra zy,' as I had said in my
12 text message ."
13 Well , I think that 's self-explanatory.
14 I'm going to hand it over to Mr. Noble.
15 Oh, I'm sorry.	Oh.	Yeah.	Okay.
16 Well, actually, I'm happy to go to members, if they
17 would like to ask some questions.

18Mr.Quigley.19MR.QUIGLEY:Ambassador, at any time did anyone detail20 what Mr. Giu li ani' s role was in Ukraine?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.
22 MR. QUIGLEY:	How did you keep aware of his activities?
23 Did anyone report to you?	Did anyone at all tell you what he
24 was doing?	The Ukrainians, for example?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.	The work on these

- - - - - - -- -



148



investigations, to make commitments to pursue these
2 investigations, was done by Ambassador Volker and Ambassador
3 Sandland.	What I knew was that Ambassador -- that they both,
4 to a greater and lesser degree, extent, had conversations
5 with Mr. Giuliani.	I don't know the nature of those
6 conversations.
7 MR. QUIGLEY:	You described, I believe, that there were
8 divergent functions taking place, official and unofficial,
9 and the Giuliani roles were unofficial.	Had you ever seen,
10 in all your years working in the field that you do, someone
11 operate in this manner?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I have seen
13 constructive input coming from outside the government into
14 the government decisionmaking process.	In particular -- in
15 every case, that was to push forward, on trying to find ideas
16 coming from the outside, to push forward an agreed policy
17 goal or objective.
18 MR. QUIGLEY:	Did they typically work together with the
19 officials?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	They typically worked together.
21 That's why you -- yeah.
22 MR. QUIGLEY:	They were aware of what each other was
23 doing --
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Absolutely.
25 MR. QUIGLEY:	-- and they knew each other's role?




149


AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Absolutely.	And they can be -
2 often can be.	I mean, there's things called -- at the
3 Institute of Peace, we do some what we call track two, which
4 is the unofficial -- track one is the official dialogue
5 between governments.	Track two is unofficial, where you have
6 former members of the government talking to former members of
7 another government.	And they come up with ideas that they
8 feed into the track one, to the formal, and they push that
9 forward.	That's common practice.
10 MR. QUIGLEY:	And, finally, did the Ukrainians ever ask
II	you about his role and what he was doing, or did -
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.	About Gi uli ani 's role?
13 MR. QUIGLEY:	Right.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.
15 MR. QUIGLEY:	They never talked to you about it?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not that I recall.
17 MR. QUIGLEY:	Very good.	Thank you.
18 THE CHAIRMAN:	I take it from your testimony,
19 Ambassador, that while there are appropriate cases to have
20 that second track, where the second track is ultimately
21 coordinated with the first track, that's not really what
22 happened here.

23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:
24 was some coordination.
 
Mr. Chairman. it's unusual.	There Occasionally I would be included in

25 some of these discussions.	I was in the first track, in the

150


regular track, and as you could see from the email s, or the
2 texts, I was included on some of those.	So there was some
3 coordination among that.
4 THE CHAIRMAN:	You know, I guess the more accurate way
5 to ask the question is, in this actual case, not like prior
6 track two discussions, the irregular channel came to co-opt
7 the regular channel in pursuit of an objective that was not
8 in U.S. interests.	Is that fair to say?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	In one aspect of the regular
10 channel -- that is, in the security assistance component of
II	the regular channel.	The regular channel is all of our
12 interactions with Ukraine, and one of the very important
13 components of that interaction with Ukraine is the security
14 assistance.	And the security assistance got blocked by this
15 second channel.
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	Well, not just the one, because it was
17 also the meeting, correct?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The meeting as well.	Yes, sir.	The
19 meeting as well.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Swalwell.
21 MR. SWALWELL:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
22 And thank you, Ambassador.
23 Do you have any reason to believe, Ambassador, that
24 anytime during your communications with Ambassador Sandland
25 that Ambassador Sandland misrepresented the directives or

151



intentions of President Trump?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No.
3 MR. SWALWELL:	How would you assess the character of
4 Ambassador Sondland?	You' ve assessed Mr. Volker's earlier.
5 Can you make the same assessment for Ambassador Sondland?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I can do facts, you know.
7 MR. SWALWELL:	Based on your facts, how would you assess
8 his integrity in this irregular process that you engaged in?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I have no reason to believe that he
10	was not acting with integrity.
11 MR. SWALWELL:	What was your concern?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	My concern about the whole second
13 track was that, apparently at the instigation of
14 Mr. Giuliani, Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker were
15 conditioning an important component of our assistance on what
16 would ultimately be a political action.
17 MR. SWALWELL:	And, Ambassador, you were asked earlier
18 about President Trump characterizing this to Ambassador
19 Sondland as "no quid pro quo, no quid pro qu o."	But as you
20 described this here, the conditions that were laid out to
21 you, at least through Ambassador Sondland relaying President
22 Trump 's wishes, you're familiar with the phrase, if it looks
23 like a duck and it walks like a duck, you can say i t's not a
24 duck, but i t's a duck?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I can just tell you the

1 52



facts.	You've stated them.	That is, apparently,
2 President -- well, Ambassador Sandland told me many ti mes
3 that President Trump said it was not a quid pro quo.	I
4 observed that , in order to move forward on the security
5 assistance, the Ukrainians were told by Ambassador Sandland
6 that they had to pursue these investigations.
7 MR. SWALWELL:	I was moved by page 8's description of
8 your trip to Donbas, and I think you included that for a
9 reason, because you also expressed the concern that 13,000
10 Ukrainians have been killed in the war.
II	Can you just talk about the human element here and what
12 it means to Ukrainians every single day that goes by where we
13 have authori zed aid, they don't see it in their bank account,
14 and Ukrainians continue to lose their lives, and what that
15 means for our security and just their livelihood?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, the Ukra i ni ans are
17 remarkably focused on the casualties in the east.
18 When Senator Johnson and Senator Murphy visited, about
19 this time, we had a meeting with the Defense Minister.	And
20 it was the first meeting of the day.	We went over there.
21 They i nvi ted us to a ceremony that they have in front of
22 their ministry every day.	Every day, they have this
23 ceremony.	And it's about a half-an-hour ceremony where
24 soldiers in formation, the Defense Minister, fami li es of
25 soldiers who have been killed are there.




153



And the selection of which soldi ers are honored, which
2 soldi ers who had been killed are honored, is on the date of
3 i t.	So whatever today's date is, you know, if we were there
4 today, on the 22nd of October, the families of those soldiers
5 who were killed on any 22nd of October in the previous
6 5 years would be there.	And --
7 MR. SWALWELL: Is it fair to say that the sooner they
8 would have recei ved the aid from the United States, the fewer
9 the casualti es would've been?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	So here's what we could say.	This
11 is -- I don' t want to overstate this.	Because it wasn't that
12 the holdup of this particular set of equipment and weapons
13 and radar and communications and vehicles, that that led to,
14 the week that I was there or even any parti cular - - we can't
15 ma ke that connecti on.
16 What we can say is that that radar and weapons and
17 sni per rifles, communication, that saves liv es.	It makes the
18 Ukrainians more effective.	It might even shorten the war.
19 That 's what our hope is, to show that the Ukrainians can
20 defend them selve s and the Russians, in the end, wi ll say,
21 "Okay, we're goi ng to stop." It's that saving of life.
22 That's how we would save liv es.
23 MR. SWALWELL: Thank you.
24 Yield back.
25 THE CHAIRMAN:	Our ti me has expired.	Forty-fi ve minutes

154


to the minority.
2 BY MR. CASTOR:
3 Q	In your statement, on page 2, you mention that,
4 when you were serving outside of government during the Obama
5 administration, after the Russian invasion, you joined two
6 other former Ambassadors to Ukraine in urging the Obama
7 administration officials at the State Department, Defense
8 Department, and other agencies to provide lethal defensive
9 weapons to Ukraine in order to deter further Russian
10 aggression?
11 A	Yes.
12 Q	Who were the two other officials?
13 A	Ambassador John Herbst and Ambassador Steve Pi fer.
14 Q	What was the objection to providing lethal
15 defensive weapons at the time?
16 A	The objection was that it might provoke the

17 Russians.
18 Q	But you didn't think that was a good argument?
19 A	I didn't.	I thought that the Russians had already
20 been provoked and they had invaded Ukra i ne.
21 Q	Uh-huh.
22 Overall, once you joined, you know, the administration
23 in Kyiv, were you happy with the package of aid?
24 A	I was happy that we were providing aid.	It could
25 always be more.	But I was glad it was coming.	I would've




155


been very unhappy if it didn't come.
2 Q	But the Trump administration had a package of aid
3 to the Ukraine

4 A

5 Q
6 A
7 Q

8 A

9 Q
10 A

11 Q

12 A
13 Q

14 A

Yes.
-- including lethal defensive weapons - Yes.
-- financial assistance -- I was very happy about that. Okay.
Yes.
And that was an improvement of years prior? It was.
Was it a substantial improvement?
It was a substantial improvement, in that this

15 administration provided Javelin antitank weapons.	These are
16 defensive weapons, and they deter, and I believe successfully
17 deter, Russians from trying to grab more territory, to push
18 forward any further tank attack, number one.	So there was a
19 military capability.
20 There was also a very strong political message that said
21 that the Americans are willing to provide more than blankets.
22 I mean, that was the previous.	And these weapons are serious
23 weapons.	They will kill Russian tanks.	So these were
24 serious weapons.	It was a demonstration that we support
25 Ukraine.





156


Q	Uh-huh.	And "the Americans are willing to provide
2 more than blankets," was that a characterization of the aid
3 in the prior administration?
4 A	The prior administration had been willing to give
5 aid, but "blankets" was just kind of the more derogatory
6 version of it, but it was nonlethal weapons.	So there was
7 communications equipment, there were vehicles, there were
8 maybe some rations, there were blankets, there were
9 night-vision goggles.	So it was a significant package, but
10 it stopped short of weapons.
11 Q	On page 5 of your statement, right around the
12	June 27th-28th timeframe

13 A

14 Q

Yes, sir.
-- you stated that you sensed something odd when

15 Ambassador Sandland told me that he did not wish to i nclude
16 most of the regular interagency participants on the upcoming
17 call with President Zelensky.
18 A	Correct.
19 Q	Who was excluded from that call?
20 A	At a minimum, his staff in Brussels.	It may have
21 also i ncluded people on the Department of Energy staff,
22 because Secretary Perry was on the call.	I don't know
23 which -- I don't think the State Department -- I don't know.
24 I don't think State Department was even planning to be on the
25 call, but I -- which is another question, why would tha t not




157


be, but that's --
2 Q	Okay.	Was the National Security Council staff on
3 that call?
4 A	No.
5 Q	Would they ordinarily be on such a call?
6 A	Not necessar i ly.
7 Q	Okay.
8 You state that, before President Zelensky joined the
9 call, Ambassador Volker advised that he planned to meet with
10 President Zelensky in Toronto on July 2nd and discuss with
11 President Zelensky, you know, how to position Ukraine for
12 this White House meeting?
13 A	It was to prepare President Zelensky for the phone
14 call, which we were trying to schedule, which, in turn,
15 would' ve been a step for the meeting -- would've been a step
16 towards

17 Q

18 A

19 Q

20 A
21 Q

22 A

Okay.
-- the scheduling of the meeting.	Yes. And did you have a concern about that? I didn't.
About what Ambassador Volker would say in Canada? I didn't have a concern.	As I think I've

23 mentioned, I didn't, at that time, understand what the code
24 was for investigations.
25 Q	Uh-huh .





158


A	And I don't even think, at that point -- I don't
2 think Kurt said anything about investigations on that call or
3 even on the prep call.	So that call, that day, there were
4 two parts; one was Americans only, and then they introduced
5 President Zelensky.	And it was in the preparatory call with
6 Americans only that Kurt said he was going to have this
7 conversation with President Zelensky.
8 Q	Right.	But Ambassador - -


9 A
10 Q

11 A

12 Q

And
Oh, I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
"But Ambassador Volker noted that he would relay

13 that Presi dent Trump wanted to see rule of law, transparency,
14 but also, specifically, cooperation on investigations to 'get
15 to the bottom of thi ngs.'"
16 A	Good point.	You're exactly right.	So I stand
17 corrected.	He did mention investigations --
18 Q	Okay.
19 A	-- in that prep part.
20 Q	And he indicated that this would be a topic in

21 Toronto in a couple days.	Is that correct?
22 A	In about 3 days, yes.
23 Q	And did you have any concerns about that?
24 A	I didn't.	As I say, I didn't know what
25 "i nvest i gati ons" referred to at this point.

159


Q	Okay.
2 A	You know, I was starting to get suspicious.
3 Q	Okay.	But once President Zelensky joined the call,
4 there was no discussion of that?
5 A	There was not.
6 Q	At the top of page 6, you state you reported on
7 this call to Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent and you wrote a
8 memo for the record dated June 30th that summarized the
9 Zelensky call?
10 A	Yes.
11 Q	Did the memo you prepared have anything in it about
12 the pre-call?
13 A	No.
14 Q	Okay.	Did you communicate with Kent anything about
15 the pre-call?
16 A	I don't think so.	I don't think so.	I'm not
17 100 percent sure.
18 Q	Now, did he ask you to write the memo or --
19 A	He suggested that I write the memo.
20 So this is on the 30th of June.	I got there on the 17th
21 of June.	I'd had a previous call on the 18th of June when I
22 first arrived, and then there was thi s.
23 So I was, as I said in the tes ti mony, realizing that
24 there are these two channels.	At the tim e, I thought it was
25 beneficial -- benign or even beneficial to have these two,





160


because they could reinforce each other, or one could at
2 least support the other.
3 But I thought it was -- it struck me -- the reason I
4 wanted to be sure that Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent
5 knew about it was he's clearly and solely in the official
6 channel, the normal channel.
7 It wasn't at all clear to me from that phone call that
8 anyone from the State Department, the normal channel, as you
9 just pointed out -- no State, no NSC -- was on the call.	I
10 just wanted to be sure that they knew that this other one was
II	going on.	It could still be benign or even beneficial, but
12 it just seemed to me that there ought to be knowledge of the
13 two.

14 Q
15 A

16 Q
17 A

Okay.	And so you discussed that with Kent? I did.
Do you remember what he said to you?
I just remember him saying two things.	One is, you


18 better write it down --
19 Q	Okay.
20 A	-- which I did.	And two, he sai d , Bill, I'm glad
21 you're out there, I'm glad that you're there, that you can be
22 the link between these two what we're now calling channels.
23 Q	Okay.
24 So did you write the memo about the call but also the
25 pre-call?




161


A	I wrote the memo about the call.	I'll have to go
2 back and look at
3 Q	Okay.
4 A	So the memo is in the documents that I submitted to
5 the State Department, so they will be available sooner or
6 later to you.
7 Q	Possibly later.
8 A	This is up to Secretary Pompeo.
9 THE CHAIRMAN:	We're hoping sooner.
10 BY MR. CASTOR:
11 Q	By mid-July, you write, it was becoming clear that
12 the meeting with Zelensky was conditioned on the
13 investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference
14 in the 2016 elections.
15 MR. SMITH:	Which page, again, was that?
16 MR. CASTOR:	It's the very next paragraph.
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.	Yeah.
18 BY MR. CASTOR:
19 Q	And so my question is, what happened in between
20 that time period?
21 A	So, actually, what I meant to imply -- what I meant
22 to suggest was that, ri ght after -- by mid-J uly, i t was
23 becoming clear.	And so, on the two paragraphs to follow
24 that, Mr. Castor, I tried to describe what led me to make
25 it -- why it was becoming clear to me that that was the case.

162




2
3	page
4

Q	Uh-huh.
A	And that is the -- oh. I'm sorry.	I've gone now to


Q	We're on page 6.

5 A	You're on page 6, but I've jumped in order to
6 answer that question about why mid-July.	It's on the 19th.
7 You have to skip ahead until we get to the paragraph that
8 starts, "In the same July 19 phone call," which on yours is
9 on page 7 in the middle.
10 This is a readout of the July 10th meeting, where you II	had Danyli uk and Yermak, Bolton, Sondland, Volker.
12 Q	Right.
13 A	And it's at that one where Sondland connected
14 i nvesti gati ons to an Oval Office meeting, Bolton walked out.
15 Q	And you learned that from Fi ona Hill?
16 A	And Alex Vindman, yes.
17 Q	Okay.	How frequently did you speak with Hi ll and
18 Vindman?	Was it on an as-needed basis --
19 A	Yes.
20 Q	-- or was it a regular schedule?
21 A	No.	As needed.
22 Q	Okay.	Any i dea why it took so long for the time
23 period between the 10th and the 19th?
24 A	The reason	I remember i t well about the 19th.
25 The 18th was the NSC meeting where the hold on security




163


assistance was first
2 Q	Okay.
3 A	-- broached.	Troubli ng.	I called these two NSC
4 people the next day.	And on that one, they gave me the
5 readout of the Ju ly 10th.
6 Q	Had you received a readout from Volker about the
7 meeting?
8 A	About the July 10th meeting?
9 Q	Yeah.
10 A	I don't think so.
11 Q	Okay.
12 A	Yeah.	I'll have to check my notes.
13 Q	Have you ever had a readout from Volker about what
14 happened in the July 10 meeting?	Or is your only i nformat i on
15 coming from Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman?
16 A	It might just be from that source of information.
17 I don't remember having a conversation --
18 Q	Okay.
19 A	-- about these other ones.	Danyliuk was,
20 obviously, in that meeting.	Yermak was in that meeting.	And
21 I' ve had multiple conversations with them, more often than,
22 actually, wi th --
23 Q	Did anyone relate to you that Danyliuk was getting
24 way into the weeds with Ambassador Bolton and it was not a
25 long meeting in --

164


A	No, no.	Actually, it was -- no.	What I heard from
2 Vindman and Hill was that the first part of that meeting went
3 well.	Substantive discussions:	security, national security,
4 both sides, energy security.
5 And, apparently, according to them, their boss, John
6 Bolton was appreciating the substance of that meeting.	And,
7 in their description, when Ambassador Sandland raised
8 investigations in the meeting, that triggered Ambassador
9 Bolton's antenna, political antenna, and he sai d , we don't do
10 politics here.
II Q	Uh-huh.
12 A	And so he ended the meeting.
13 Q	Okay.	Did anyone provide you a readout that
14 Danyliuk was talking about establishing new types of
15 institutions in the Ukrainian Government?
16 A	I don' t remember that.
17 Q	Okay.


18 A

19 Q

No.
And so no one related to you that Danyliuk was

20 getting into the weeds with Bolton?
21 A	No.
22 Q	On Ju ly 10th	going back to the paragraph on
23 page 6   begi nni ng wi th, 11  0 n J uly 1011        -      -

24AYes.25Q-- you met with Zelensky'sChief of Staff and
165


then-foreign policy advisor, who had advised you they had
2 heard from Mr. Giuliani?
3 A	Ah.	Yes.	This is the one where I mentioned that
4 they had heard this via -- they had heard from Giuliani via
5 the Prosecutor General Lutsenko.
6 Q	Okay.	And you relayed your concerns to Counselor
7 Brechbuhl?
8 A	Brechbuhl.	That's correct.
9 Q	What was his feedback?
10 A	Again, the Counselor to the Secretary is focused a
II	lot	I won't say mainly, but focused a lot -- on personnel
12 issues.	And yet it was he who	I had two meetings with
13 him, one just before the one with the Secretary in May.	And
14 i t was he who said, "Look, Bill, call me anytime if you've
15 got questions or problems.	I can check with the Secretary
16 and"	so that's why I called him.
17 Q	So he is someone who had great influence with the
18 Secretary, right?
19 A	He is very close -- he and the Secretary go back a
20 long ways.
21 Q	Okay.	So if you, you know, communicated your
22 concerns to Brechbuhl
23 A	Yes.
24 Q	-- on July 10th --
25 A	Yes.




166


Q	--	wasn't that, in effect, a signal that your
2 concerns before you took the post were coming to fruition?
3 A	Yes.
4 Q	Okay.	And did Brechbuhl have a -- did he recognize
5 that?	And did he realize that this was part of having your
6 back and
7 A	He did.	He did.
8 Q	the other commitments that were made to you?
9 A	And I think I talked to him a couple of times along
10 these lines.	And. again, it comes up when we talk about the
II	security assistance.	You know, I called him that time as
12 well.	He said he would check.	So he was responsive.	It
13 wasn't in his area of -- he didn't do this day-t o-day .	So he
14 had to talk to other people about -- other people in the
15 State Department about this.
16 Q	And then the next event
17 MR. JORDAN:	Can I jump in for just a second?
18 MR. CASTOR:	Sure.
19 MR. JORDAN:	I want to go back to the July 19th call you

20 had with Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vi ndman.
21 Ambassador, you initiated that call?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I think so.
23 was on my -- I remember seeing it on the schedule.
24 again. the troubling NSC meeting was the 18th.
25 MR. J ORDAN:	Understood.

You said,


I know it So,




167



AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And the 19th, it may have been a
2 prescheduled call.	I can't remember if I initiated it or
3 not.	Was that the question?
4 MR. JORDAN:	If it was prescheduled with the NSC, would
5 Dr. Hi ll or Mr. Vindman have scheduled that call with you?
6 Who would've scheduled that?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I can't remember who did i t.
8 MR. J ORDAN: You get to Ukraine on June 17th.	Is that
9 right?
IO	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes, sir.
II	MR . JORDAN:	All ri ght.	So you're there 1 month.
12 J une 17th and July 19th, how many conversations did you have
13 with Dr. Hill and/or Li eutenant Colonel Vindman in that month
14 time period?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	This might have been the first one.
16 MR. J ORDAN:	This i s the first one?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	This could have been the first one.
18 MR. JOR DAN:	And you don't know who initiated it?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The only reason I'm hesi tati ng -- I
20 know that I was concerned about the 18th call.
21 MR. JORDAN:	I understand.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And they were on that.
23 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And I know that it was actua lly on
25 my schedule.	Sometimes -- well, I remember seeing it on the

168


schedule.	So sometimes when there's kind of a
2 spur-of-the-moment call it doesn't show up on my schedule.
3 But this was on my schedule.	So it was scheduled to happen
4 the following day.	I can't remember if it had been
5 previously scheduled and I just took advantage of it or if I
6 scheduled it right then because I wanted to talk about the

718thmeeting.8MR. JORDAN:	If it had been previously scheduled, do you9knowwhy it would've been previously scheduled?10AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don' t.IIMR. JORDAN:	Okay.	So would you guess it originated12withthe NSC calling you?13AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I can't speculate. I can't14 remember.
15 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	But thi s is the only call you've had
16 with him in the month that you've been there as Ambassador?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I think that's correct.
18 MR. JORDAN:	And just to go back where our counselor
19 was, it was both about your concerns that you had learned the
20 day before, relative to security assi stance dollars --
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
22 MR. JORDAN:	-- and then they volunteered to tell you
23 about their July 10th meeting, ri ght?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
25 MR. JORDAN:	And did you talk to them about your

169



July 10th meeting in Ukraine with the individuals you had met
2 with, Mr. Zelensky's Chief of Staff?	Did you fill him in on
3 that as well?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't think I did.
5 MR. JORDAN:	Is it fair to say the bulk of the
6 conversation was Dr. Hill and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman
7 relating to you what happened at the July 10th meeting here
8 in the United States?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: The first part of the conversation
IO	was about what we had all heard the day before
II	MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	about this security assistance
13 being held up.	And none of the three of us had any idea why.
14 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And then they went into this other
16 discussion about the July 10th meeting.
17 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	Any idea which took the bulk of the
18 time of the phone call?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm sure the July 10th -- discussion
20 of the July 10th meeting took the bulk of the call.
21 MR. JORDAN:	The bulk of the time was on this meeting
22 that took place at the White House.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
24 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
25 Steve, thank you.

[3:05 p.m.)
2 BY MR. CASTOR:
3 Q	During this time period, did Volker ever talk to
4 you about his view of whether the aid would be released?
5 A	Yes, I can't remember specific conversations, but I
6 remember we had conver sati ons, and we all agreed that it
7 would be released. We were all sure it would be released.
8 The fact is we want	we were hoping that it would be
9 resolved, released, decided, reversed, li fted, whatever the
10 ve rb is, before the Ukrainians heard about it because we
II	didn't want to be in the position I found myself later on
12 being embarrassed and not be able to say.	So we hoped that
13 it would be fixed, and they would never hear about i t, and we
14 wouldn't have to explain.
15 Q	And from time to time, this happens with aid.	It
16 gets held up, r i ght?
17 A	Sometimes aid gets held up.	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
18 Q	For whatever reason?
19 A	Mr. Castor, I don' t know.	So I've been in the ai d

20 business for a long time.
21 Q	I mean, you know you can snicker about this, but --
22 A	No, no, no, I'm not.
23 Q	You're not snickering at this.	Let me be clear,
24 you're not sni cker i ng.	But i t's been related to us that thi s
25 happens from time to time.	Aid gets held up for whatever

171


reason
2 A	So I'm trying to -- Mr. Castor, I've done a bunch
3 of aid stuff as I mentioned here.	Aid can be held up when,
4 you know, if there is a CR or something, you know, if ther e's
5 a congressional -- it could be a congressional hold.	Yes, so
6 there are instances that aid gets held up.
7 Q	Okay.	But in this instance, everyone was aligned
8 you thought that we ought to work through this and the aid
9 will be lift -- the hold will be lifted.
10 A	Because I was convinced, and all indications were
11 that everyone in the interagency community that had anything
12 to do with this aid was in support of that aid flowing.
13 Q	And bipartisan Members of Congress?


14 A

15 Q

16 A

And bipartisan Members of Congress.
And, ultimately, the hold was lifted, ri ght?
And, ultimately, the hold was lifted on the 11th of


17 September.
18 Q	In total, the Ukrainians knew about this for what
19 about 10 days?
20 A	They knew that there was a hold on the 29th, and
21 they knew it was lifted on the 11th of September.

22 Q
23 A

Twelve days? [Nonverbal response.]

24 During that time, I got a lot of questions about it.
25 Q	Fair enough.	During the July 19th call, was it

172


discussed the status of the upcoming call between the
2 Presidents?	Ther e was a July 25th call between President
3 Trump and Zelensky that's attracted some attention?
4 A	You're talking about with Fiona Hill and Alex
5 Vindman?
6 Q	Right.
7 A	I don't recall.	I don't think so.	I think
8 actually I could check my text messages.	Scheduli ng that
9 call was a challenge.
10 Q	Okay.
11 A	And it went back and forth in terms of time.	So I
12 don't think I had a conversation with Vindman and Hill about

13thatatthat point.14QWhat was NSC's position on the call?15AThey opposed it.16QOkay.	And so Dr. Hill opposed it?17ACertainly her boss opposed it.18QSo Ambassador Bolton opposed the call?19AHe did.20QOkay?21AAnd that was clear from the Ju ly 10th meeting.22QSo whoever set up the call --23AYes.24Q-- it wasn't Ambassador Bolton, right?25AI thi nk that's right.
173


Q	So you didn't know anything about the call on the
2 19th, and then it was scheduled on the 25th?
3 A	You say I didn't know about the call?	I --
4 Q	You were talking to Fiona Hill.	I'm going back to
5 the 19th?
6 A	Yeah, yeah.
7 Q	You're on the phone with Dr. Hill and Lieutenant
8 Colonel Vindman?

9 A
10 Q

And we were talking about two things. Two things.

II	A	We were talking about why this assistance was put
12 on the day before, and we're talking about -- and they are
13 relating the discussion of July 10th with Danyliuk and
14 Bolton.

15 Q

16 A

17 Q

Right.
And the call was not yet locked in, scheduled. Okay.

18 A	And it was going back and forth -- there was some
19 talk.	There was some -- as I recall, there was, you know
20 it was on and off, the call's on, the call's off.	It is
21 scheduled for here.	Not going to happen.	I could go back
22 through the records if you want.
23 Q	Okay.	To the extent that you can recall --

24 A

25 Q

Yes.
-- when did you then learn that this July 25th call





174


would be scheduled?
2 A	I -- well, we were trying to schedule it for about
3 a week in advance, that whole week.	As I say, back and
4 forth, yes, no, this time, that ti me.	So that was -- I was
5 doing it on the Ukrainian side and trying to go back to the
6 -- try i ng to keep the NSC advised as to what was going on.
7 And I think it was kind of -- it may have been about the day
8 before that it was actually locked down, so about the 24th.
9 Q	Okay.	And did you find out why --


10 A
I I	Q

12 A

Why?
-- the change.
No.	As you just made the point, Ambassador Bolton

13 was not interested in having -- did not want to have the call
14 because he thought it was going to be a disaster.	He thought
15 that there could be some talk of investigations or worse on
16 the call.	Turned out he was right.	So he didn't want to
17 have the call.	I thi nk it was the Chief of Staff who helped
18 schedule that call.
19 Q	Mr. Mulvaney?
20 A	Mr. Mulvaney.
21 Q	Okay.	Do you remember when you finally found out
22 that the call was happ eni ng and you had to go alert the
23 Ukrainians?
24 A	We were alerting the Ukrainians back and forth.	We
25 had given them a couple of head fakes all the way through




175



about this is going to happen; this is not going to happen.
2 And probably the day before.	Now the other thing is the
3 White House situation room can work directly with the
4 Ukrainians as well.	Most of the time, they would come
5 through me, and I would kind of set the stage.	But when it
6 gets to the actual final hours of its schedule, they will --
7 they can call directly to the Ukra i ni ans.
8 Q	Okay.	Also, on the July 19th call, Dr. Hill
9 informed you that Volker had met with Giuliani to discuss
10 Ukraine?

11 A

12 Q

Yes.
Was that the first time that you knew Volker and

13 Giuliani were talking about?
14 A	You know, Mr. Castor it was about that time -- I
15 was looking at my notes last night or the night before -- it
16 was about that time that I heard from Dr. Hill that Kurt
17 mentioned -- Kurt sends a text that I have to check to see if
18 I was on, but in some text that Kurt sent about this time, he
19 said:	I had a good breakfast with Mr. Giuliani.	Maybe you
20 have already pointed this out earlier today.	Was that right?
2 1	It was in one of your test --
22 Q	I don't think I pointed that out, but fair enough.
23 A	So, so here's what I know.	Ambassador Volker sent
24 that text to at least Ambassador Sandland and maybe -- maybe
25 the three-way -- I can't remember.

176


Q	Uh-huh.
2 A	But he said, had a good breakfast with Mr.
3 Giuliani.	And oh, then he also -- I think I was not on this
4 one, but I've seen it in some document that says that had
5 Kurt 's note back to Rudy Giuliani saying:	Thanks for the
6 good breakfast and had a good time.
7 So it was about that same time.	And I think that's the
8 same contact that Fiona Hill was talking about, about the
9 same time.
10 Q	Okay.	Did you have any direct conversations with
II Volker about that or just the text?
12 A	The text that I think I was asked and I di dn't get
13 a response.
14 Q	Okay.	So you never had any idea what Volker was
15 communicating to Giuliani?
16 A	Correct.
17 Q	Also, on July 20th, which is the next day, you sent
18 or you had a phone conversation with Danyliuk where the
19 discussion of being a pawn had come up.
20 A	Yes.
21 Q	Did you communicate that concern to anybody, such
22 as Brechbuhl or Kent?
23 A	I did it -- I expressed the concern to Volker and
24 Sandland, as I said here.	I don't recall going to Brechbuhl
25 or Kent.

177



Q	Okay.	But that would have been another fact -- if
2 you had gone to Brechbuhl, that would have been another fact
3 that pointed to the concerns that you discussed before you
4 took the post?
5 A	Yeah.	The whole thrust of this irregular channel
6 was to get these i nvest i gati ons, which Danyliuk and
7 presumably Zelensky were resisting because they didn't want
8 to be seen to be interfering but also to be a pawn.
9 Q	Right.
10 A	Right.
II	Q	But you said the irregular channel is -- it
12 happens.
13 A	It does.
14 Q	And it can be okay?
15 A	It can be okay.	It can be helpful.	In this
16 case	yeah.
17 Q	But at some point, the irregular channel in your
18 view became a problem?

19 A

20 Q

It did.
And you had the facts from Fiona Hill and Volker

21 and that side, and then now you're getting the facts from the
22 Ukraine side?

23 A

24 Q

Correct.
And I'm wonderin g, at this point, did it crystalize

25 to you that the irregular path was going to be more of a

178


concern than you anticipated?
2 A	Yes.	The general way I have described it is,
3 during the month of July, it began to be clear --
4 Q	Okay.
5 A	-- that this was a problem.
6 Q	Did you	I know you sent the cable on the 29th
7 after you spoke with Ambassador Bolton. but at any point in
8 time between the 20th and learning that, did you have any
9 official State Department higher up discussions?
10 MR. GOLDMAN:	Can you clarify 20th and 29th, which?
11 MR. CASTOR:	July.	Do you follow?
12 MR. GOLDMAN:	I don't think there was a cable on Ju ly
13	29th.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	August 29th.
15 MR. CASTOR:	August 29th.
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Which makes your point?
17 BY MR. CASTOR:
18 Q	So thi s is what I'm getting to, is, what did you do
19 between now and the 29th to alert Mr. -- Counselor Brechbuhl
20 or Kent or somebody that this is becoming a problem, this is
21 irregular?
22 A	So before the cable -- so August when it was
23 becoming -- Ju ly, I started to identify the problem of the
24 second channel, in particular with regard to the meeting.	So
25 then the assistance gets put on hold, and that gets to be




179


goes a month, goes from July 18th into the middle of August
2 and still is not resolved.	It is attempting to be resolved,
3 and there were descriptions to me from Tim Morrison of how
4 they tried to get the principals in the same room, couldn't
5 do it, schedules, et cetera.	I then -- I did, I called
6 Counselor Brechbuhl, talked to John Bolton --

7 Q
8 A
9 Q
10 A

II	Q

This is much later. This is in August. Okay.
This is in August.
I'm just -- after the, you know, it seems like the

12	July 20th communication you had with Danyliuk really
13 crystalized that this was also becoming a concern on the
14 Ukrainian side of things.


15 A

16 Q

It was a concern on the Ukrainian side.
And I'm just wondering if you did anything right

17 then and there other than Sondland, Volker channel?
18 A	I will check again.
19 Q	Okay.	And then the July 25th call happens.

20 A
21 Q
22 call?

Yes.
Who did you get a readout from about the July 25th

23 A	Three people.	One was a very short message from
24 Danyliuk, which said:	Went well.	Oh, there was also the
25 Ukrainians put out -- the Ukrainian Office of the President





1 80



put out a short descrip ti on. Turned out, looking back on it,
2 that's not a bad one because it talks about corrup ti on and
3 worki ng on cor r upti on would improve relat i ons and that kind
4 of thing, and then kind of normal workin g -- so that was
5 that.
6 Tim Morrison and I had a conversation on the 28th.	So
7 that was, what, 3 days later.	And he had	this is one
8 where he said, "It could've gone better," or something.	I
9 took it as a sarcasti c comment:	It coul d have gone better.
10 And then he described several of the things that
I I	happened on that call.	He ment i oned that Gi uli ani came up in
12 the call.	He menti oned that he - - he men ti oned that Gordon
13 Sondland had talked to Presi dent Tr ump before and after the
14 call.	So that was not in the call, but that was before and
15 after, he told me.	And he ment i oned that the so-called
16 previous Ambassado r, Ambassador Yovanovitch, was a topic of
17 the call.
18 Q	Okay.
19 A	So there was that.
20 I got one other readout of the call and thi s was from
21 George Kent.	And his was secondhand.	So George Kent had
22 talked to Alex Vindman, who had been on the call.	So George
23 hadn't been; Alex had.

24 Q

25 A

Was Morrison on the call? I'm sorry, who?

181


Q	Was Morrison on the call?
2 A	I think so, yes, yes.	I'm sure he was.	I'm sure
3 he was.	Yes, the answer is yes.
4 George was not.	George talked to Alex Vindman, and
5 George then relayed Alex's comments to me.	There was a
6 difference in their two readouts of the call in one specific
7 respect, and that is Tim Morrison was sure that President
8 Trump had asked President Zelensky to fire prosecutor general
9 Lutsenko.	Lutsenko was still on the job because he had -- he
10 had to stay on the job until Rada takes him off, so he was II	still on the job.	And Giuliani, we know, wanted to keep
12 Lutsenko on the job out there.	And Tim Morrison's
13 recollect i on or recounting of the call was that President
14 Trump asked President Zelensky to fire Lutsenko.	Vindman to
15 Kent to me said the opposite, that is, that President Trump
16 said, ''Keep Lutsenko," again because Lutsenko and Giuliani
17 were -- so that actually -- and that turned out to be the
18 case.	We now know, going back to the transcript we saw on
19	September 25th, we know -- we think, it is a little bit
20 unclear on that transcript, but we're pretty sure that
21 President Trump in the transcript asked President Zelensky to
22 keep	it said, I understand you fired or you're about to
23 fire or you're not going to keep this very good prosecutor
24 general, and we think that's a mistake.	So it turns out that
25 the Vindman description of that aspect was the correct one.





182




2andTim Morrison actually got that one wrong.
Q	Okay.	So you spoke with Morrison and Vindman.3A	I spoke to Kent, who had talked to Vindman.4Q	Okay.	Anybody else?5A	And Danyliuk and the report from the --6Q	Anybody else before the matter became public at the7endof September?8A	No.9Q	Okay.	So that's sort of the roster of --10A	That's the roster of reports.11MR. CASTOR:	I'm at my	ther e's about 10	minutes lef t.12I'dlike to pivot to our members.13MR. ZELDIN:	Ambassador Taylor, on page 9, the second
14 paragraph.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I'm sorry.	Which page?
16 MR. ZELDIN:	Page 9 of your opening statement, where you
17 discuss Mr. Yermak asking the United States to submit an
18 official request for an investigation into Burisma's alleged
19 violations of Ukrainian law.
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	Was tha t request ever made by the United
22 States?
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, not to my knowledge.
24 MR. ZELDI N:	On page 10	of your opening statement, so
25 second paragraph from the bottom in the middle of the




183



paragraph, you say, quote , "I was hopeful that at the
2 bilateral meeting or shortly thereafter, the White House
3 would lift the hold, but this was not to be."	The hold was
4 released just 10 days later, correct?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
6 MR. ZELDIN:	Also, on page 10,	same paragraph at the
7 bottom you say, quote, "The Vice Presi dent did say that
8 President Trump wanted the Europeans to do more to support
9 Ukraine and that he wanted the Ukrainians to do more to fight
10 corruption," end quote.	Doesn't that align with U.S. law and II		policy what the Vice President stated?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It does.	And as I understand it,
13 Congressman, when President Trump decided not to go to Warsaw
14 and ask Vice President Pence to go for him, President Trump
15 asked Vice President Pence to make those two points.
I6	MR. ZELDIN:	Whi ch, as you just stated , i s enti rely
17 consistent with U.S. law and policy, correct?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	We want the Europeans to do
19 more for Ukraine, and we want them -- the Ukrainians	to do
20 more to fight corruption.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	And on page 11,	the third paragraph down,
22 you say, quote:	In fact, Ambassador Sondland said, quote,
23 "everythin g" was dependent on such an announcement, including
24 security assistance.
25 Ukraine never made such an announcement, correct?

184




2AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
MR. ZELDIN:	And the hold was still released just 103dayslater. correct?4AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct.5MR. ZELDIN:	On page 12. first paragraph, on September65th,I hosted Senators J ohnson and Murphy for a visit to7Kyiv.During that meeting, did President Zelensky say
8 anything to Senators Johnson and Murphy about a quid pro quo?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir .
10 MR. ZELDIN:	Did you say anything to Senators Johnson
11 and Murphy about a quid pro quo?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.
13 MR. ZELDIN:	On page 12, the middle paragraph, you
14 talked about a conversation with Mr. Morrison.	And this
15 phone call, was Morrison on that call?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, that's a good question.
17 I don' t know what	I don't know how he knew that.	It was
18 the same -- then. in the next paragraph, Ambassador Sandland
19 told me that he had a conversation with President Trump.	And
20 so I	and I think they were talki ng about the same
21 conversation.	I think those two paragraphs talk about the
22 same conversation.	And I don' t know how Tim Morrison --
23 unless he may have been on the call, or he may have talked to
24 Sandland after the call.
25 MR. ZELDIN:	I might get back to that, but at the bottom

185



of page 12 and the bottom of page 13 as well, so I'm skipping
2 ahead to the bottom of page 13, it says, again, I asked
3 Mr. Danyliuk to confi rm that there would be no CNN interview,
4 which he di d.	It seems throughout your opening statement
5 you're talking about thi s demand for a public statement in
6 order to release aid to Ukraine, but no announcement was ever
7 made and the aid was still released, right?
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
9 MR. ZELDIN:	Earlier on, you had an exchange with the
10 chairman.	He asked you with regards to the legal definition
II of the term "quid pro qu o."	I believe you sai d something to
12 the effect of "I don't speak Latin," corr ect?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Sorry.
14 MR. ZELDIN:	Correct.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
16 MR. ZELDIN:	In your opening statement, though, you do
17 use the words "quid pro quo."
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I only quote other people using
19 those words, Congressman.
20 MR. ZELDIN:	Okay.	At the very end of your opening
21 statement, you do make a reference to quid pro quo as one of
22 the two Ukraine stories.	On page 14 --
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Ah, I do, yes, sir.
24 MR. ZELDIN:	So i t's an i mportant question for us to ask
25 you, if you' re going to use that term "quid pro quo, " for us

100


to ask you what you mean by it, and we're not going to --
2 obviously, we wouldn't accept the answer that you don't speak
3 Latin.	We want to know what you mean about it.	I'll let
4 Mr. Ratcliffe get into that further with you.
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	Let's take a 5- or 1O-minute break, and
6 then we'll resume.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Sure.

[4:45 p.m.]
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Let's go back on the record.
3 Folks, settle down a bit.	Let's go back on the record.
4 Just a few follow-up questions before I hand it over to
5 Mr. Noble, Ambassador.
6 My colleagues on the minority asked you about general
7 circumstances in which aid may be wi thheld , that this kind of
8 thing happens .	So I want to ask you a little further about
9 tha t.
IO	There are certainly legitimate occasions when aid is
II	withheld, such as when Congress decides in its policy
12 judgment to withhold aid.	Am I right.
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
14 THE CHAIRMAN:	And there may be other circumstances.
15 changing conditions on the ground somewhere, where a decision
16 will be made to withhold aid, appropriately so, correct?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
18 THE CHAIRMAN:	But you can distinguish between
19 appropriate circumstances in which aid is withheld and
20 i llegi ti mate circumstances in which aid is withheld to coerce
21 another country to do something i mproper.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	You can.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	Now, my colleagues asked you, well,
24 ultimately the aid was released.	I thi nk the thinking is no,
25 you know, no harm no foul, it ultimately was released.	But

188



at the time that it was released are you aware that the White
2 House was in possession of a whistleblower complaint -- now
3 public -- that alleged that the assistance may be withheld
4 for reasons of wanting leverage over Ukra i ne for political
5 investigations?	Were you aware that at the ti me it was
6 released the White House already knew the existence of this
7 complaint?
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Chairman, I don' t know that.
9 THE CHAIRMAN:	Were you aware at the time that it was
10 the aid was released that in fact there were public reports
11 in newspapers that the aid may be withheld for this improper
12 reason?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	When it was released, on September
14 11th, when i t was released?
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	When the aid was eventually released --
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Right.
17 THE CHAIRMA N:	-- were you aware there were already
18 public reports suggesting perhaps that it was being withheld
19 for inappropriate or inexplicable reasons?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	In the press?	I don't reca ll.
21 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't recall.
23 THE CHAIRMA N:	And we'll check the timeline.	That's my
24 recollection, but I could be wrong.
25 So if I can go back to your test i mony.	At the bottom of




189



page 10 you talk about a phone call you had with Mr. Morrison
2 in which "he went on to describe a conversation Ambassador
3 Sandland had with Mr. Yermak at Warsaw.	Ambassador Sandland
4 told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not
5 come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma
6 investigation.	I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me
7 about the Sondland-Yermak conversation.	This is the first
8 time I had heard the security assistance -- not just the
9 White House meeting -- was conditioned on the
10 i nvest i gati ons."
11 At that point did you understand that unless the
12 Ukrainians did this for President Trump, that is committed to
13 these investigations, they were not going to get that
14 military assistance or that meeting?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Mr. Chairman, what I know for sure
16 is what Mr. Morrison told me that he must have heard
17 Ambassador Sandland tell Mr. Yermak.	And as I said, this was
18 the first time I'd heard those two put together, those
19 connected.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	And when you say that, this was the first
21 time I heard that the security assistance -- not just the
22 White House meeting -- was conditioned on the investigation,
23 when you talk about conditioned, did you mean that if they
24 didn't do this, the i nvesti gati ons, they weren' t going to get
25 that, the meeting and the military assistance?





190


AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That was my clear understanding,
2 security assistance money would not come until the President
3 committed to pursue the investigation.
4 THE CHAIRMAN:	So if they don' t do this, they are not
5 going to get that was your understanding?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	Are you aware that quid pro quo literally
8 means this for that?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Noble.
11 BY MR. NOBLE:
12 Q	Thank you.	Thank you, Chairman.
13 Ambassador, just sticking in this same general
14 timeframe, still on page 10 of your statement, on September
15 1st you wrote that you had a conversation with Mr. Danyliuk
16 to let him know that the delay of the U.S. security
17 assistance was a, quote, "a ll or nothing proposition, in the
18 sense that if the White House did not lift the hold prior -to
19 the end of the fiscal year, September 30th, the funds would
20 expire and Ukraine would receive noth i ng."
21 How did Mr. Danyliuk respond when you told him that?
22 A	Mr. Noble, the reason I told him that, the reason I
23 made it clear that it was all or nothing, was that he had
24 sent me an earlier note, a note just before that, saying,
25 well, it's a gradually increasing problem, that we're

191


gradually missing out on this assistance.
2 And I wrote back and sai d , no, Alexander -- Sasha
3 Mr. Danyliuk, if the hold is not lifted, in part i cular by the
4 end of the fi seal year, then it goes away.	And he was
5 thinking that it was just kind of -- it would be dribbled
6 out.
7 So in answer to your que sti on, did he respond, nothing
8 substantive.	I mean , he may have said thank you or
9 something.
10 Q	Subsequently, though, did you have conversations
I I	with the Ukrainians?	I mean, did they become increasingly
12 concerned when the freeze remained in place and they weren't
13 getting an explana ti on why, and you had told that them these
14 funds may evaporate completely?
I 5	A	Yes.	And they -- I may have mentioned this
16 already, I can't remember -- they could not understand why it
17 was being held.	And they suggested, well, maybe if I just go
18 to Washington and convince the President or convince the
19 Secretary of Defense that this i s.important that that would
20 do the trick.	They were trying to figure out why this was
21 being held.
22 Q	But then at some point, and again later on page 10,
23 Ambassador Sondland , i t appears, told Mr. Yer mak, Presi dent
24 Zelensky's adviser, that the money would not come unt i l

25 Zelensky committed to pursuing the Burisma investigation.	Is


that right?
2 A	That is correct.
3 Q	So, I mean, did the Ukrainians have an
4 understanding at that point what they had to do in ord er to
5 get the funds released?
6 A	Certainly Mr. Yermak di d.	That's what he had heard

7 from Ambassador Sondland.
8 Q	Okay.	I want to go back now to the first ti me you,
9 I believe, learned of the freeze.	Was that during the J uly
10 18th SVTC
II A	It was.
12 Q	you had?
13 I'd li ke to ask some questions about tha t and the other
14 interagency meetings that you had.
15 Can you just tell us how did you participate in the SVTC
16 on Ju ly 18th?
17 A	So the way i t works is that in the White House, in
18 the Old Executive Office Building, there is a room, there's a
19 series of rooms where they have interagency meetings.
20 MR. BELLINGER:	I'm not sure all of this is public.
2 1	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Ah.
22 MR. BELLINGER:	You guys have to scrub it later .
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Fair point.	Thank you, Counselor.
24 You thi nk it might be classi fi ed that there are those?
25 Anyway, yeah.

193



MR. BELLINGER :	No, no, no.	It used to be, it used to
2 be, but times have changed.	It was classified when I was
3 there.
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Okay.	So --
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	I am just going to interject.	I want to
6 make sure we're not going it to get into classified

7 information today.
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	We're not.
9 these classified rooms is classified.



Unless the existence of I can't -- which I

10 don't think it is.

1 1
12 Q

BY MR. NOBLE:
Perhaps a way to navigate this would be to shortcut

13 it and just say it's a conference call system.
14 A	Thank you.	That's a good idea.	It is a conference
15 call.

16 Q
17 A

18 Q

Okay.
It is a secure conference call. Okay.

19 A	I'm in Kyiv.	I'm in a secure room.	Can I say
20 tha t?	And there are several other satelli te officers that

21beamin.And we're all in different parts of --22QSo this is a video conference?23AIt's a video conference, a secure video conference.24QOkay.	So you can see who the other participants25are?




194


A	It depends on -- so if the camera is right there,
2 all of those folks can be on the screen but I'm not, because
3 i t's going right over my head.	So the answer is most, but
4 not all.	And I couldn' t see the person who said -- the 0MB
5 person who said:	I've been told to stop this.
6 Q	Okay.	Do you know the identity of the 0MB staffer?
7 A	I don't.
8 Q	But you believe -- I believe your testimony said
9 you believe it was a female staffer?
10 A	It was.
I I	Q	Okay.	And to this day you still don't know who it
12 was that announced it?

13 A

14 Q

I don't.
Did you participate in the subsequent interagency

15 meetings about the aid?
16 A	One of them.	As I say, there -- this was a
17 sub-PCC, so a Sub-P oli cy Coordination Committee.	And then
18 there is a Policy Coordination Committee, and that is chaired
19 at the assistant secretary level.	And then there 's a
20 Deputies Committe e.	And then there's a Principals Committee.
21 And then ther e's an NSC meeting.
22 And it went	and so I was present and beamed in from
23 Kyiv for the sub-PC and the PC, but not the ones above that.
24 Q	Okay.	Can you tell us what happened at the PCC
25 meeting, the second one?




195



A	Yes.	Around the room, observations, information
2 about the value of the assistance.	In particular OSD, I
3 think it was Laura Cooper, who is probably on your list, made
4 a very strong case and continued to make a very strong case
5 for the effectiveness -- indeed, her office was the one
6 overseeing this assistance, so she made a very strong case
7 for that.
8 Others around -- the State Department representative,
9 strong statement, we made a strong statement about the
IO	importance of this assistance.
11 Q	And was there an 0MB representative there for that
12 meeting?

13 A

14 Q
15 A

16 Q

I don't know the answer. Okay.
Probably.
Do you recall whether there was any communication

17 from the White House or from 0MB regarding the freeze and
18 whether it was going to stay in place at that meeting?
19 A	I don't.	I think coming out of that meeting was
20 the instruction that we're continuing -- that we're
21 continuing the policy as it had been.	And, probably after
22 the PCC, the State Department and maybe the Defense
23 Department decided they were going to move forward with this
24 assistance anyway, 0MB notwithstanding.	Thi s was a big
25 decision that L came to over there, over some debate as to

196


whether or not they could do it without OMB's clearance, send
2 a CN to the Hi ll without OMB's clearance, and they decided to
3 do that.	I don't know if they've ever done that before.
4 This was a big decision for them.
5 Q	So as far as you know, that was unprecedented?
6 A	As far as I know.
7 Q	Was that related to the FMF or USA! portions of the
8 assistance?	Do you know?
9 A	I think both.
10 Q	Do you know whether there was any kind of written
I I	documentation of kind of the decisions made at these
12 meetings?
13 A	There is every ti me.
14 Q	Okay.	And State Department would have a copy of
15 those?
16 A	NSC would probably have those.
17 Q	NSC.
18 A	And they were then sent out to the interagency,
19 including the State Department.
20 Q	Okay.	Are you aware whether there were any kind of
21 preconditions or certifications that had to be made with
22 respect to Ukraine before the funding could flow?
23 A	In this case, for --


24 Q
25 A

Yeah, for this assistance.
The only thing I heard was that there was a request

197


-- and I'm not sure who it came from, but it may have come
2 from the NSC -- to the Defense Department for an evaluation
3 of the assistance to be sure that it was being well spent and
4 it was effective.	And the Defense Department came back very
5 quickly with the conclusion that it was.
6 Q	Well, we've heard claims that President Trump was
7 interested in corruption or concerned about corruption
8 generally in Ukraine.	Are you aware that DOD, in
9 consultation with the State Department, had certified that
10 Ukraine had taken sufficient steps to address corruption such
11 that they were entitled to the aid at that time?
12 A	Mr. Noble, I'm not sure.	I think in the Defense
13 Authorization Act every year there are conditions that are
14 required to be met in order for that assistance to go
I 5	forward.	And my understanding is those conditions were met.
16 On this specific one I'm not sure.	I think so.
17 Q	Okay.	In your statement on page 4 you reference
18 several actions that President Zelensky had taken quickly to
19 address corruption in Ukraine, including opening Ukraine's
20 High Anti-Corruption Court, which had been a U.S. policy goal
21 for quite some time.
22 A	We played a big role in that, yes.
23 Q	And President Zelensky had done that at that point?
24 A	He had done that and he showed up himself at the
25 opening of the High Anti-Corruption Court -- with the two

198


Senators, by the way.	They were both there as well.
2 Q	Which two Senators?
3 A	Senator Murphy and Senator Johnson.
4 Q	And then President Zelensky had also. after winning
5 control of the Rada, he changed the Ukrainian Constitution to
6 remove absolute immunity from Rada Deputies, which you say in
7 your statement was a source of corruption for over two
8 decades.	Is that right?
9 A	So Rada Deputies -- I imagine Representatives in
10 this body and in the Senate would love to have this -- but
11 the Rada Deputies in Ukraine up until the point where they
12 changed the Constitution could commit any kind of crime and
13 not be prosecuted.
14 And that was changed, he changed that right away, a
15 commitment that he'd made in his campaign, and he made good
16 on that commitment right away.	And overwhelming support.	It
17 had been promised every Rada by every President before, it
18 never happened.	He got it done.
19 Q	So not only had President Zelensky campaigned on
20 rooting out corruption, I believe his number one priority,
21 but he had taken concrete steps.	And yet the 0MB. the
22 President, still had decided to freeze the aid purportedly
23 because he had some concerns about corruption in Ukraine?
24 A	It is certainly true that he made -- he is not only
25 fighting corruption.	So he changed the -- President Zelensky

199



changed the language.	He said he wants to defeat corruption.
2 So he was really focused on this, he made it his number
3 two priority.	Number one priority was stopping the war on
4 Ukrainian terms and number two was defeating corruption.	And
5 he did a lot on that.
6 And it was -- we talked earlier about how we're focused
7 on institutions fighting corruption.	So the High
8 Anti-Corruption Court and the Special Prosecutor and all, the
9 in sti tut i onal way of fighting corruption, rather than case by
JO	case.
II And so, yes, he pushed that very hard.
12 Q	Okay.	So I want to move, fast forward a little bit
13 to August.	And I noticed in your statement that there's a
14 little bit of a ti me gap between -- on page 9	between July
15 28th to the middle of August, to August 16th, between the
16 first and second paragraphs on page 9.
17 And I also noticed that in the text messages that we
18 have in which you're a participant that Ambassador Volker
19 produced, there's also a similar gap in that timeframe.
20 So if you take the	if you have the text messages and
21 you turn to -- let's go to page 28 fir st.	And if you look at
22 -- I'll direct your attention to the top there.	And
23 beginning on or around August 11th -- well, actually, yeah,
24 back to the top there.
25 So these are text messages between you and Ambassador





200


Volker.
2 A	Okay.
3 Q	There's one July 24th, 2019, where Volker says:
4 Hi, Bill.	Can you talk now?
5 Do you see that?
6 A	I do.
7 Q	And then it skips forward till August 3rd and you
8 have a discussion about:	Did Tim -- I believe that's Tim
9 Morrison -- say how he was doing on the call?
10 And then it skips forward to August 11th.	And it's not
II	until August 16th, I believe, that you kind of start talking
12 again about the investigations or the requests for a White
13 House meeting.	Do you see that?
14 A	I do.
15 Q	Okay.	And then, if you move to page 38, so this is
16 the three-way text message chain between you and Ambassador
17 Volker and Ambassador Sandland.	And if you look toward the
18 bottom, there's a big gap between August 6th, 2019, and it
19 then jumps to August 29th, 2019.	Do you see that?
20 A	I see that, ri ght.
21 Q	Do you recall whether you had any WhatsApp
22 conversations with Ambassador Sandland and Ambassador Volker
23 basically du r i ng the month of August, or the last 3 weeks of

24 August?
25 A	From the 6th to the 29th?




201


Q	Yeah.	Do you know whether there'd be any messages
2 that might have been deleted here?
3 A	Oh, I don't know if it's possible to delete on

4 these thi ngs.
5 gap.

I don' t know.	I don't know the reason for the

6 Q	Okay.
7 A	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	The State Department has all of
8 mine.	I have them as well.	But, yeah, the State Department
9 has all of these.
10 Q	Okay.	But in this timeframe were you aware that
I I	Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland were in direct
12 communication with Mr. Yermak and with Mr. Giuliani about the
13 drafting of a statement that they wanted Presi dent Zelensky
14 to release?
15 A	So only after -- only after Ambassador Volker
16 released his texts.	I thin k that's where they showed up.
17 Q	So you weren't involved, as far as you can
18 remember, in the drafting of that?
19 A	I was not.
20 Q	Okay.	So that was something that Ambassador Volker
21 and Ambassador Sondland were doing with Gi uli ani and Yermak?
22 A	Yes.
23 Q	Okay.	So I would like to show you kind of the end
24 result of that process.	If you turn to page 23 of the text
25 messages.	And, again, these aren't ones that you were on.

202



But the last couple messages on that page, from August
2 13th, 2019, this is an exchange between Ambassador Volker and
3 Mr. Yermak.
4 And Volker writes:	Hi , Andrey.	Good talking.
5 Following is text with insert at the end for the two key
6 items.	We will work on official requests.
7 And then Ambassador Volker drafts -- pastes the
8 statement that they want President Zelensky to release.	And
9 it reads:	"Speci al att enti on should be paid to the problem
10 of in terfer ence in the political processes of the United
11 States, especially with the alleged involvement of some
12 Ukra i ni an poli ti ci ans.	I want to declare that this is
13 unacceptable.	We intend to initiate and complete a
14 transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts
15 and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016
16 elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this
17 problem in the future."
18 So this is a draft statement that Ambassador Volker and
19 Ambassador Sondland had drafted wi th Rudy Giuliani for
20 President Zelensky to release.	Were you involved in the
21 craftin g of this?
22 A	I was not.
23 Q	Okay.	So you had no knowledge that this was going
24 on at the time?
25 A	I had no knowledge.

203


Q	Were you aware of any statement general ly that --
2 A	I wasn 't until I saw these once they were released.
3 Q	Okay.	How did you react when you learned, I guess
4 from seeing Ambassador Volker' s text messages, that this had
5 been going on behi nd the scenes, given that you're the Charge
6 d'Affai res in Ukrai ne, and yet you have no idea that Volker
7 and Sondland are working with Giuliani and Yerma k to get out
8 a statement from the President of Ukraine and you had no idea
9 that that's goi ng on?	Did that concern you?
10 A	It di d.	When I found out about it	again, this II	was the i rr egular channel, I was in the regular channel.
12 Every now and then I would see what was going on in the
13 i rregu lar channel, but not in this case.
14 And, yeah, I mean, I should have been involved, but I
15 knew that ther e were a lot of communications between
16 Ambassador Volker preceding -- and President Zelensky and
17 Yermak -- preced i ng my arrival.	They had a relationship.
18 And si milarly	with Ambassador Sondland.	Ambassador
19 Sondland had a relationship, he told me, I don't know -- I
20 think this is true -- that he could WhatsApp and phone and
21 call President Zelensky.	And normally, in a normal
22 arrangement, the ambassador helps either facilitate that or
23 monitors that or is at least aware of that and gets
24 back-bri efed on tha t.	I had accepted that this was an
25 unusual ci rcumstance.

204



Q	I mean, is it -- would you say or would you agree
2 that these text messages and the orafting of this statement
3 was, in effect, making concrete the quid pro quo that you had
4 real iz ed in mid-July, as you describe in your statement, that
5 a White House visit was dependent on President Zelensky
6 making a public commitment to those two specifics
7 investigations?
8 A	So again, being careful about my use and
9 understanding of quid pro quo, which is i mperfec t at best,
10 the facts were that these relationships between the
II announcement and the meeting -- or phone call and the meeting
12 -- and then the security assistance, it was clear to me that
13 there was that relati onshi p.
14 What I didn't know was there were these -- this drafting
15 session, thi s drafting exercise to put together the language
16 that President Zelensky would use.
17 Q	Okay.	I want to fas t forward a little bit to
18	September 7th or 8th.	Do you recall sending George Kent a
19 WhatsApp message regarding your conversation with Ti m
20 Morrison about what President Trump wanted Zelensky to do?
21 Do you recall telling George Kent about that?
22 A	Is this mentioned in my statement --
23 Q	No, but if you go to your statement - -
24 A	September 5th.	Thi s is with - - Senators Johnson
25 and Murphy were in town.

205


Q	And then on page 12 in the middle.
2 A	Ri ght.
3 Q	It says you had a call with Mr. Morrison where he
4 had a, qu ote, sinking feeling --
5 A	Yes.
6 Q	-- after learning about the conversation that
7 President Trump had with Ambassador Sandland.
8 A	Yep.
9 Q	Did you relay that in a written communication to
10 George Kent?	Do you remember that?
II	A	I don't remember.
12 Q	Can we go back to the text messages and turn to
13 page 53,	the last page?
14 A	Okay.	I'm informed that on my text message there
15 was a text back to George Kent.
16 Q	Okay.
17 A	So let me be clear.	I didn't remember it until
18 just now and this great colleague back here reminded me that
19 this was there.
20 Q	Okay.	And those text messages have been turned
21 over to the State Department?
22 A	They have, they have, they have.
23 Sorry, where are we now?
24 Q	Sure.	Last page of the text messages, page 53.
25 A	Yes.

206


Q	At the top of the page, I believe, on September
2 8th, 2019, 11:20 a.m. Gordon Sondland says:	Guys, multiple
3 convos with ZE.
4 That's Zelensky, correct?
5 A	Yes.
6 Q	And POTUS.

7 A
8 Q
9 A
10 Q

l l	A

12 Q

Yes.
President Trump . Yes.
Let's talk. Right.
And then you go on to have a conversation, which I

13 believe is the conversation you describe in your statement.
14 Is that right?
15 A	Yes.
16 Q	On page 12?


17 A

18 Q

Yes.
Okay.	And that's where President Trump had made

19 clear that if Zelensky did not, quote, "cl ear things up in
20 publ i c," there would be a, quote, "stalemate ." Is that
21 right?
22 A	That is correct.
23 Q	And you understood that stalemate meant that
24 Ukraine would not get the military assistance?
25 A	That's correct.




207


Q	Okay.	Was Ambassador Volker on that call with you
2 and Ambassador Sondland?
3 A	I'm sure he was, yes.
4 Q	During that call, did you discuss the possibility
5 of President Zelensky
6 A	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	On the phone call?
7 Q	The phone call, yes.
8 A	No, no, no, no.	The phone call was just --
9 Q	Just you and Sondland?
10 A	Yes.	Right.	Sorry.	The text was the three of us,
11 the phone call was just the two of us.
12 Q	Okay.	During that phone call did you discuss the
13 possibility of President Zelensky doing the CNN interview
14 during the YES Conference in Ukraine?	Is that when that
15 first came up?
16 A	That's when he -- yes, that's when Ambassador
17 Sondland said that he had talked with them and they -- and
18 the Ukrainians had agreed to do a CNN interview.
19 Q	Okay.	Can you just describe in a little more
20 detail your recollection of that conversation with Ambassador
21 Sandland?	Was this the first time you had heard the idea of
22 President Zelensky making a public announcement on CNN about
23 these investigations?
24 A	It was certainly the first time I'd heard about it
25 on CNN.	We'd had earlier conversations about making public





208


comments.	I thin k that is the case he re.	I'm remembering
2 the thing about the i nterest that Ambassador Sondland had in
3 having President Zelensky go in a box, in a public box.	So
4 there were those conve rsati ons on a couple of occasions.
5 This is the first time on CNN , talking about CNN i nterv i ew.
6 Q	And do you recall the dates of the YES Conference?
7 When was this interview supposed to take place?
8 A	The interview, the CNN interview I think was going
9 to be in UNGA, which is at the end of September.	The YES
10 Conference was the first week in September, as I recall,
11 maybe the first -- oh, no, no, sorry.	It was the Friday,
12 Saturday -- Saturday is the 14th of September.	But I
13 don't -- and there was a lot of press at the YES Conferenc e.
14 I don't think there was talk about doing an interview there.
15 Q	Okay.	So you thi nk that the interview that
16 President Zelensky was going to do that you discussed with
17 Ambassador Sondland during your call on September 8th was
18 going to be during UNGA?
19 A	When we were talking about it on September 8th, I
20 think it was not clear when i t was going to be.
21 Q	Okay.
22 A	And when it di dn' t -- when it di dn't happen, di dn' t
23 happen, and then they were approaching the UNGA meeting on,
24 what, the 25th of September, then they got more serious
25 then I started hearing about the CNN i nte rvi ew. And so it


































13 A	"The nightmare" is the scenario where President
14 Zelensky goes out in public, makes an announcement that he's
15 going to investigate Burisma and the election in 2016,
16 i nterference in 2016 election, maybe among other things.	He
17 might put that in some series of investigations.
18 But he had to -- he was going -- the nightmare was he
19 would mention those two, take all the heat from that , get
20 himself in big trouble in this country and probably in his
21 country as well, and the security assistance would not be
22 released.	That was the nightmare.
23 The Russians loving it.	The Russians are pay i ng
24 attention.	The Russians are paying attention to how much
25 support the Americans are going to provide the Ukrainians.

210


The Russians are leani ng on Ukraine.	They are leaning on
2 Ukraine about Donbas.	They are leani ng on Ukraine about
3 sovereign -- small little sovereign countries here, little
4 statelets.	They are leaning on economically, they have got
5 the Nord Stream coming through, they have got -- they are
6 putting pressure on -- they have to come to a new gas
7 agreement by the 1st of January.
8 So they are leaning on them.	And they, the Russians
9 want to know how much support the Ukrainians are going to get
10 in general, but also what kind of support from the Americans.
I I	So the Russians are lovin g, would love, the humiliation
12 of Zelensky at the hands of the Americans. and would give the
13 Russians a free r hand, and I would quit.
14 Q	And why would that make you quit?
15 A	That's exactly the scenario that I was worried
16 about when I had my meeting with Secretary Pompeo on the 28th
17 of May where I said:	Mr. Secretary, you know, your current
18 strong policy of support for Ukraine is one I can support and
19 I would be glad to go out to Kyiv and support it and push it
20 hard.
21 However, I told him and the others who were in the room,
22 if that changes	and this would have been a change, this
23 would have been	it was a nightmare.	This would have been
24 throwing Ukraine under the bus.	And I told the Secretary:
25 If that happens, I'll come home.	You don't want me out

21 1


there, because I'm not going to defend it, you know.	I would
2 say bad things about it.	And you wouldn't want me out there
3 doing that.	So I'm going to come home on that.	So that was
4 the message about I quit.
5 Q	And did you communicate that, these concerns around
6 this time to Secretary Pompeo or --
7 A	I had done so on August 29th.
8 Q	In your -- in the cable?
9 A	Correct.
10 Q	What was the distribution on that cable?
11 A	It was called "NODIS."
12 Q	Okay.	What's that mean?
13 A	So it's very limited distribution.	It's also first
14 person, which means the way it reads is:	Mr. Secretary, I
15 am concerned -- I, Bill Taylor -- I am concerned about this
16 problem.
17 So that's first person.	Normally these cables are not
18 first person, they are third person.	So it gets attention,
19 there are not many first person cables coming, so it gets
20 attention when it comes in from the ambassador saying:	I am
21 concerned.
22 And "NO DIS" means that it is very limited distribution.
23 It goes obviously to the Secretary.	And then if other people
24 want to read it they have to come up to the Operations Center
25 in the State Department and they can go into the special room

212


and they can read it.
2 Q	And in your statement, I believe page 10, you said
3 you heard soon thereafter the Secretary carried that cable
4 with him to a meeting at the White House focused on security
5 assistance for Ukraine.	Where did you hear that from?
6 A	Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent.
7 Q	Okay.	And do you know what, if anything, else
8 Secretary Pompeo did after receiving your cable to follow up?
9 A	I know that -- I know that he had been pushed -- I
10 think I mentioned that after the July 18th meeting where the
1 I	assistance was frozen by the 0MB hand, that there were a
12 series of these meetings, up to and including Secretary of
13 State and Defense.	And so I know that Secretary Pornpeo was
14 working on this issue, that he wanted it resolved.
15 I was getting more and more concerned that it wasn't
16 getting resolved.	And so I wanted to add my concern and my
17 arguments, from the perspective of Kyiv and the Ukrainians,
18 about how important this assistance was.
19 Q	Okay.	And you said -- how did you learn that the
20 aid had been unfrozen?	I believe it was on September 11th,
21 is that right?
22 A	It was September 11th.	So, yeah. I remember
23 getting an email from a staffer, a Senate Armed Services
24 Committee staffer.	And of course Senate staffers -- House
25 staffers too, I'm sure -- get the word much earlier than

213



anybody else.
2 And so I got this email, I think it was probably
3 overnight, which I then sent to Tim Morrison and I think
4 maybe to George Kent saying:	Oh, this is great news.	This
5 i s what we've been waiting for.
6 And Tim hadn't heard it yet.	So that's how I first
7 heard.	And then he later that day confirmed.
8 Q	Okay.	Are you aware that The New York Ti mes
9 published some communi cati ons, some emails, relat i ng to the
10 release of the freeze that involved you on October 9th, 2019,
II with a State Department employee, Brad Freedon (ph)?
12 A	Oh, I do remember this, yes.
13 Q	Do you recall those emai ls?
14 A	This is the one where Brad said something about
15 nothing to see here, move along.
16 Q	I believe the quote is:	Keep movi ng people,
17 nothing to see here.
18 A	There you go.
19 Q	Did you have any communications with Mr. Freedon
20 (ph) or anyone else at the State Department about why they
21 wanted to keep the release of the funds quiet?
22 A	No, I di dn't have a conversa tion wi th Mr. Freedon
23 (ph) on this one.	I i magi ne that - - my unde rstandi ng -- my
24 view of this was that, as I said earlier, this was an
25 embarrassment, this freeze on assistance was a mistake, an

214


embarrassment, and it was going to be fi xed, it had to be
2 fixed.	And the less said and the less attention it got, the
3 less embarrassing it was.
4 So I was fine with don't talk about this or, you know,
5 let's not make a big deal of this. 6

[4:23 p.m.]
2 BY MR. NOBLE:
3 Q	Okay.	On or about September 14th, so after the aid
4 was released, do you recall a meeting that you and Ambassador
5 Volker had with Andriy Yermak?
6 A	I do.	It was a dinner.
7 Q	A dinner.	Can you tell us what happened at that
8 dinner?
9 A	One of the things that happened was Mr. Yermak
10 described to Kurt and me, described to Ambassador Volker and
11 me, their plans for a resolution of Donbas, how they were
12 going to get to a resolution with Donbas.
13 There was a fourth person there, another of his -
14 another Ukrainian colleague.
15 There were a couple other topics discussed, Mr. Noble,
16 but anything in particular that I should try to remember?
17 Q	Do you recall anything about an investigation
18 involving former Ukrainian President Poroshenko coming up
19 during that meeting?
20 A	I do.
21 Q	Can you tell us about that conversation?
22 A	Yes.	I can.	I can see Ambassador Volker has been
23 here.

24 Yes, so Ambassador Volker suggested to Mr. Yermak and
25 Mr. Novikov, the other Ukrainian, that it would be a good





216


idea not to investigate President Poroshenko, the previous
2 President.	And one of the reasons Kurt said that was there
3 were indications, and maybe even some actions taken by that
4 time, that made it clear that the new government, the new
5 Zelensky government, was going to go after President
6 Poroshenko for a range of issues, on things like -- people in
7 this room will remember that President Poroshenko was in
8 office at the time of the Kerch Strait incident.	This was
9 Thanksgiving a year ago, when the Russians attacked these
10 Ukrainian patrol ships, patrol boats.	And President
II	Poroshenko was getting blamed for and being possibly even
12 taken to court for some of those military decisions that he
13 made.
14 And, at that dinner, both Mr. Yermak and Mr. Novikov
15 took out their cell phones -- I,	of course, don't have -- but
16 took out their cell phones and pulled up pictures of their
17 relatives -- one was a brother, and one was a cousin -- who
18 had been killed or wounded in the east.	And they showed this
19 to Kurt and me, and they said, Poroshenko is responsible for
20 this.
21 There was a deep-seated anger at Poroshenko at an
22 emotional level.	And that was one of the things
23 motivating -- one of the things motivating the attacks on, or
24 the court cases on President Poroshenko.	Not the only ones.
25 There were others.	This oligarch that I mentioned earlier,

217


Kolomoisky, also had it in for Poroshenko.
2 And Kurt said, you know, you should move forward, don't
3 prosecute Poroshenko.	And they responded, take a look at
4 this.
5 Q	Do you recall Yermak saying anything to the effect
6 that, why shouldn't we investigate Poroshenko when you're
7 pushing us to investigate Joe Biden?
8 A	Oh, I don't remember that, but -- I don't remember
9 that.
10 Q	Okay.
II	After the freeze was lifted, it sounds like, from your
12 statement, you still had concerns that President Zelensky
13 might go forward with the CNN i nterv i ew and still announce
14 the in vesti gati ons.	Is that right?
15 A	That's ri ght.
16 Q	Why did you have that concern that that was going
17 to happen?
18 A	I had the concern because I had a couple of
19 meetings with President Zelensky and Andrei Bohdan, his Chief
20 of Staff, about this time.	It was just after -- it was on
21 the 13th, I think , of September, just after the hold had been
22 released.
23 And walking out of that meeting, Andriy Yermak was about
24 to walk in.	And I had just said to President Zelensky,
25 bipartisan support of Ukraine in Washington is your most

218


valuable strategic asset, don't jeopardize it.	And don't

2 intervene

don't i nterf ere i n our elections, and we won't

3 interfere in your elections.	I had just said that to
4 President Zelensky, and on the way out I said the same thing
5 to Andriy Yermak.	And the body language was such that i t
6 looked to me like he was still thinking they were going to
7 make that statement.
8 Q	At that point, had there been a White House meeting

9 for President Zelensky scheduled?

10 A
II	Q

No.	And there still hasn't been. Okay.

12 Did you participate in UNGA?	Were you here in New York?


13 A

14 Q

No.
No?	Did you help prepare for President Trump' s


15 meeting with President Zelensky?
16 A	Yes.	I sent in a suggestion to Tim Morrison on
17 what should -- you know, what he could use as the President's
18 talking points when he sat down with Zelensky, basically
19 making the point that, you know, correct, a good, solid,
20 substantive conversation.	Yeah.	And that's in the cables,
21 I'm sure, that the State Department is preparing.
22 Q	Okay.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	I'd like to give priority to the members
24 that have been here for most of the day.
25 Mr. Welch?

2 1 9



MR. WELCH:	I'll be brief.
2 I just want to, first of all, thank you.	But I've been
3 li steni ng all day and -- pretty much all day, and what I
4 understand your testimony more or less is, succ i nctly -- and
5 correct me if I'm wrong -- is:	You have a longstand i ng
6 in terest in Ukraine; it's been the U.S. policy since 1991 to
7 support Ukraine; that the policy has been internally for
8 Ukraine to fight corruption, and we've been supportive of
9 that, externally to resist aggression from Russia, and we
10 were trying to be supportive of that; that when you were
II	faced with this question of whether to return to public
12 service at the request of Secretary Pompeo, you had a frank
13 conversati on where you made it clear that you had to be
14 assured that you could defend what had been the consistent
15 United States policy in both those respects; that if, in
16 fact, you were unable to do that or the policy changed, you
17 candidly said you would have to quit; that you then began
18 your service on the understanding that the policy was to
19 fi ght internal corruption and to resist external aggression;
20 and that, as ti me developed, you started having questions as
21 to whether there was a secondary channel for that policy;
22 and, over time, you came to see that not only was there a
23 secondary channel but tha t it included a policy variance from
24 the traditional one of fighting aggression and corr upti on;
25 that you had specific information from people who had talked

220



to President Trump, including Mr. Volker and Mr. Sandland,
2 that what that policy was was essentially to extract an
3 agreement from the President of Ukraine to do these
4 investigations and tha t everything, not just the White House
5 meeting but the aid itself, was conditioned on getting that
6 agreement and that explicit statement; and, at the end, there
7 was an effort to, quote, put Pres i den t Zelensky in a box,
8 whi ch the public statement would make him do.
9 Is that a fair summary of what you've said?
I O	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Excellent summary, Congressman .	The
II one thing -- the only clarification I would make is that, in
12 the begi nni ng, in late J une and early J uly, in J uly, there
13 was, in my vi ew, my observation, not a conflict.	There was
14 not a conflict --
15 MR. WELCH:	Right.
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	-- between these two channels.
17 MR. WELCH:	No. And you were clear that just having
18 somebody outside of the normal State Department isn't
19 necessar i ly a bad thing.
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Correct.
21 MR. WELCH:	Having two poli ci es was the question.
22 But just a couple more, because I want to yield to my
23 colleagues.
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Welch, our time has expired.
25 MR. WELCH:	Okay.

221



THE CHAIRMAN:	We'll come back to you at the very top of
2 the next.
3 MR. WELCH:	Sure, Mr. Chairman.	I yield.
4 THE CHAIRMAN:	Thank you.
5 Forty-five minutes to the minority.
6 BY MR. CASTOR:
7 Q	Where we last left off was a discussion of -- it
8 was right around the time of this telephone call, July 25th.
9 A	25th, yes.
IO		Q	And the very next day, you had a meeting with II	President Zelensky.
12 A	Correct.
13 Q	And I think you told us that feedback from the call
14 from the Ukrainians was positive, for the most part.
15 A	Yes.
16 Q	They had put out a statement --
17 A	They had put out a statement.	They'd mentioned
18 investigations or -- I should look at that statement.	But
19 they had mentioned something that led me to believe that they
20 were in the same meeting , that they were describing exactly
21 that call.
22 Q	Okay.	So --
23 A	Law enforcement, I think it was.	Yeah, yeah , yeah.
24 Q	Was there any other discussion during that meeting
25 that was a fallout from the call?

222



A	Not that I recall.	The bulk -- so it was
2 Ambassador Volker, Sondland, and I were all there.	And the
3 bulk of the call, after the brief conversation about the --
4 I'm sorry.	The bulk of the meeting after the brief
5 conversation about the call was on how to solve Donbas.
6 Q	Were you surprised when you read the whistleblower
7 complaint?	And, first of all, did you see the whistleblower
8 complaint before i t was public?
9 A	No.
10 Q	Okay.	So it was made public, I think, on Thursday,
II	September 26th.
12 A	Okay.
13 Q	Were you surprised when there was a discussion of
14 this July 26th meeting in the whistleblower complaint?
15 A	Mr. Castor, I remember reading that quickly, but I
16	may have missed that July -- but can you remind me what
17 the
18 Q	Sure.
19 A	Yeah.
20 Q	On page 4 of the complaint -- we can give you the
21 complaint.
22 A	I'm sure I have it somewhere, but that's okay.
23 Q	You know, it states that Ambassadors Volker and
24 Sondland reportedly provided advice to Ukrainian leadership
25 about now to navigate the demands that the President had made

223


to Zelensky.
2 Does that ring any bells?	Does anything of that sort --
3 A	This is in the 26th meeting?
4 Q	Yeah.
5 A	Advice to Zelensky about how to navigate the --
6 Q	Demand s of the President.
7 A	I was in that -- so the records of - - my records of
8 that meet i ng are in the State Department, and they will come.
9 Q	Okay.

10 A

II	Q

12 A
I 
don't recall that. Okay.	By that
Ah.	Ah.	Thank you, Counsel.

13 He did ask -- one thing that was i n addi ti on to the
14 brief conversation about the call and Donbas, and it may have
15 been at the end, President Zelensky still expressed his
16 interest in the face-to-face meeting in the Oval Office.
17 Q	Okay.

18 A

19 Q

Yeah.	Thank you.
But by that point in ti me, from your limited

20 knowledge of what had occurred on the call, you di dn' t know
21 that the President had made any demands or there was anything
22 to nav i gate.
23 A	Correct.
24 Q	Okay.	So, to the extent the whistleblower
25 complaint chronicles that -- and you were in the meeting, and

224



you don't remember anything of that sort.
2 A	I don't remember that.
3 MR. MEADOWS:	Steve, let me -- your response, that you
4 don' t remember that, is really an indication that you don't
5 recall that happening.	Is that correct?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
7 MR. MEADOWS:	Okay.	I just wanted to clarify that.
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	Yes.	Good point.
9 BY MR. CASTOR:
10 Q	Now, the various requests for the Ukrainians to
II open in ve sti gat i ons that had been closed, did you have any
12 opposition to the effort for Ukraine to investigate,	you
13 know, Ukrainians that had been engaged in wrongdoing that may


14 have
15 A
16 Q


Just in general?	Was that the question?	Or - Right.	You di dn' t have any objection to

17 investigations being reopened tha t genuinely deserved to be
18 reopened?
19 A	So when President Zelensky comes into office --
20 well, even before that -- when he runs for President and then
21 is elected and then takes office, again, his second priority
22 was defeating corruption.	And he said, I think in the call,
23 in the July 25th call, he said he has a new prosecutor
24 general, who is very good, by the way.	And President
25 Zelensky said, this man will do the investigations and, you

225


know, he will enforce the law.
2 Q	Okay.
3 A	And so, yes, he committed to have Prosecutor
4 General Ryabshapka, and then again recently saying that he'll
5 take a look at all these --
6 Q	Uh-huh.
7 A	-- take a look at all these cases.
8 Q	Okay.

9 There was a reference to reaching out to the Justice
10 Department.	You mentioned Deputy Assistant Attorney General,
II	which I assume is Bruce Swartz?

12 A
13 Q

14 Swartz?
I 5	A

16 Q

17 A

18 Q

It is.
Did you ask Ambassador Volker to reach out to Bruce


He volunteered to do that.
Okay.	And what was the feedback from Swartz? I don't know that they ever connected.
Okay.	And was there any followup effort to close

19 the loop with the Justice Department?
20 A	No.	I thought the whole thing was a bad i dea.
21 Q	You thought it was a bad idea to reach out to Bruce
22 Swartz?
23 A	No.	I thought the idea of the Americans asking the
24 Ukrainians to investigate a violation of Ukrainian law was a
25 bad i dea.

226


Q	Okay.
2 A	But Kurt, for some reason, wanted to pursue that.
3 And when he volunteered to take that question to Bruce
4 Swartz, that was fine with me.
5 Q	Okay.	I mean, is it possible that Swart z's
6 feedback on that issue would have been compelling to the
7 group?	Like, why didn't anyone follow up with Swartz?
8 A	No idea.
9 Q	Okay.
10 You called Counselor Brechbuhl on August 21st to engage
11 about whether there was a change in U.S. policy.
12 A	Yes.
13 Q	And presumably that was on the heels of the
14 security assistance being held up?
15 A	Yes.
16 Q	Was that the first time you had engaged Brechbuhl,
17 you know, in the month of August?
18 A	In the month of August?
19 Q	Uh-huh.
20 A	So I'd had a couple meetings with him before I
21 left.

22 Q

23 A

Right.
I called him early on, I think in -- this may have

24 still been July, about the security assistance, and then -- I
25 think about security -- and then called him again.

227



Q	Okay.2A	Yeah.3Q	So, on the 8/21 call that you mention on page 9 of4yourstatement5A	Yep.6Q	-- did you, at that time. alert him that you had
7 concerns about the irregular channel?
8 A	At that tim e?	Let's see.	At some point, I had a
9 conversati on wi th him about -- I wasn' t calling it the
10 irregular channel at this point.	I was talking about
II Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker.	And it might have
12 also been in this case.

13 Q

14 A

15 Q

16 A

17 Q

Okay.
But it was not the main thing. Okay.
The main thing was secur i ty assistance.
Okay.	I'm just wondering, you know, during July

18 and August, you're getti ng increasingly concerned, correct?

19 A

20 Q

Correct.
It culminates on August 27th when you wrote this

2 1	first-person cable.
22 A	I sent it in on the 29th.
23 Q	Okay, but the end of Augu st, right?
24 A	Right.
25 Q	And then by September 8th, you' re discussing the

228


prospect that you might have to qu i t, right?
2 A	I was discussing tha t even earlier.	I was -- my
3 cable on the 29th hinted at that as well.
4 Q	Okay.	And so. on the 21st. did you raise any of

5 these concerns?
6 A	Yes.
 
I mean. you had him on the telephone, right? Yes.	So when I asked him explicitly about a

7 change i n poli cy, he and I both remembered that a change in
8 policy was what I was concerned about on May 28th.	And this
9 is why on a couple of times we've had that conversation.	He
10 knew exactly what I was talking about.
II	Q	Okay.	And did he give you any feedback or -- I
12 mean. you're sounding -- are you sounding the alarm?	Is that
13 a fair characterization?
14 A	I'm sounding the alarm on the 21st.	I'm sounding
15 the alarm on the 23rd.	I had another conversation, oh, with
16 Tim Morrison, I think, asking the same question.	Is that --
17 am I getting these numbers right?	Next day, yes. on the 22nd
18 with Morrison. I asked him the same thing, had there been a
19 change in policy.
20 Q	Uh-huh .
21 A	So, yes, I am getti ng increasingly concerned.	I'm
22 trying to get from Washington what's going on.
23 Q	And did Brechbuhl give you any indication that he
24 was going to talk to the Secretary or he hears you loud and
25 clear --

229



A

2 Q
3 A
4 Q

5 A

6 Q
7 A

8 him.

Hears me --
and he'll try to do something about it?
He says, "I will check." Okay.
"I will check." And did he check?
I don't know.	I didn't hear anything back from


9 Q	Okay.

10 And then Ambassador Bolton comes to Ukraine on
II	August 27th?
12 A	Correct.
13 Q	And did you discuss these issues with him at that
14 time?
15 A	At the end of -- yes.	Yes.	At the end of his --
16 he was there for, like, 3 days.	And the second day -- he
17 left the morning of the third day, early.	The evening of the
18 second day, which I think is maybe the 28th of September or
19 so, I asked for a meeting with him to talk about this.	And,
20 agai n, th i s i s the 28th.
21	September 29th is when the word leaks out in the
22 Politico article, okay, there is a hold on -- so it wasn't
23 out then, and, thus, it wasn't a topic of conversation with
24 the Ukrainians.	And he saw the full range of Ukrainians,
25 including the President.

230


But I knew it.	And I asked him at the end of his
2 meeting, at the end of his visit, before he went to bed, if I
3 could have a session with him.	And I di d, and I raised
4 exactly this question.	It was he who suggested then at that
5 meeting that I write this note to Secretary Pompeo, which I
6 did the next day.
7 Q	Okay.	Did he urge -- he didn't urge a telephone
8 call or anything of that sort?
9 A	No.	He urged the first-person cable to get
10 attention back there.
II Q	Okay.	Did you ask him whether he was trying to
12 work the issue from his vantage point?
13 A	He indicated that he was very sympathetic.	I had
14 known from earlier conversations with people that he was also
15 trying with the two Secretaries and the Director of the CIA
16 to get this decision reversed.	So he confirmed that and
17 urged me to make my concerns known to the Secretary again.
18 MR. SMITH:	Before we leave this, I think the Ambassador
19 said the meeting was on September 27th.	It was August 27th.
20 MR. CASTOR:	Okay.
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.	Oh, did I say September?
22 MR. SMITH:	I thi nk you did.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you, Counselor.
24 MR. MEADOWS:	So, Ambassador -- can I follow up with
25 just one clarifying?




231


So, Ambassador, you said that you were aware of
2 Ambassador Bolton's advocacy for this.	You were aware of
3 that how?	From whom?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I was aware, Congressman, in the
5 discussions that followed the meeting at the NSC where the
6 hold was put on.	And it rapidly went up the chain to
7 Ambassador Bolton.	And was told a couple of times by people
8 at State and people at the NSC that the Secretary of Defense,
9 Secretary of State, the Nati onal Security Advisor, and the
10 head of CIA all strongly supported the resumption of this
II	assistance.
12 MR. MEADOWS:	Who told you that?	That's what I'm trying
13 to get at.	I mean, who were the conversations with?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm sure they were with Deputy
15 Assistant Secretary of State George Kent.
16 MR. MEADOWS:	From the State Department standpoint.
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The State Department.
18 MR. MEADOWS:	All ri ght.	From the NSC standpoint	I
19 mean, who would have direct knowledge of what Ambassador
20 Bolton had done or was doing that conveyed that to you?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, again, what I know is
22 those principals were trying to get together with the President to have this meeting.	So, knowing that
24 MR. MEADOWS:	Right, but you said somebody told you
25 about Ambassador Bolton's advocacy --

232


AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's what I was referr i ng to.	I
2 was referring to that I knew what his posi ti on was, because
3 he wanted to get that group together to make the case.
4 MR. MEADOWS:	So did he tell you he was getting the
5 group together?	Or who told you the group was getting
6 together?
7 I guess I'm a li ttle concerned on who at NSC would've
8 been telling you about Ambassador Bolton.	You felt li ke he
9 was a ki ndred spirit on this.	So who was telling you from
10 the NSC tha t he was?
I I	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It would've been either -- it
12 would've been Tim Morrison.	But I can't remember the
13 specific phone call.
14 But, again, the main reason I know where Ambassador
15 Bolton was was that interest in getting it reversed, getting
16 the decision reversed, and the way to do that was to get a
17 meeting with the Presi dent .	So that was my main source of
18 i nformat i on. And that came, as I say, from the State
19 De partm ent.
20 BY MR. CASTOR:
21 Q	And then you had a subsequent conversation with
22 Morrison?	It sounds like you' re talking to Morrison pretty
23 much every day dur i ng this time period?
24 A	"Every day" is too strong, but -- let's see.	Yeah.
25 So Morrison is with Bolton.




233



Q	Okay.
2 A	So he's in Kyiv.	He goes on to Warsaw with Bolton,
3 and he and I have conversations from Warsaw.
4 Q	Okay.	What's Morrison's background?	Where did he
5 come from?
6 A	He came	so he took Fiona Hill's place, coming
7 from another part of the NSC doing arms control, and I don't
8 know what before that.
9 Q	So you sent the first-person cable where you
10 mention the term "folly."


11 A

12 Q

I did.
Did you get any feedback from the seventh floor on

13 that cable?

14 A

15 Q

16 A

I got feedback from the sixth floor on that. Okay.	What feedback did you get?
I got feedback saying, I'm glad you sent that

17 cable.

18 Q

19 or
20 A

Okay.	Did you get any feedback from the Secretary


I didn't.	I didn't.	As I say, I know he carried

21 i t with him to one of these meetings where they were going to
22 try to reverse the decision, but no direct feedback.
23 Q	Okay.	How about from Mr. Brechbuhl?
24 A	Nope.
25 Q	Anybody else?

234


A	Not -- no, again, other than the desk.	I somehow
2 made sure -- I	think I	sent an email to Ulrich Brechbuhl to
3 ensure that he saw that cable, and he may have sent back an
4 acknowledgement that he'd seen i t.
5 Q	Okay.
6 After the hold was lifted --
7 A	Yes.
8 Q	-- and the funds started to flow, was there any
9 other activities that concerned you in the irregular channel?
IO	A	Not that I can remember.
II Q	Okay.	I mean, you talked about the statement, the
12 possible CNN interview, and some of these
13 A	Correct.

14 Q
15 A

-- concerns from that channel.
Correct.	But that had been in train for -- so I

16 was trying to be sure that the things from the other channel
17 that had been put in place, like the CNN interview, d i dn' t
18 happen.
19 Q	Okay.
20 A	And then the focus was on UNGA, as we said, on the
21 General Assembly.	And that, of course, was back into the
22 regular channels, I mean, all the preparations for that.
23 Q	Did any of your conversations with Morrison reveal
24 any concerns about the Giuliani-Sandland-Volker channel from
25 that point on?




235


A	Not that I recall .
2 Q	Okay.	Did you ever have any communications with
3 Morrison after the aid was released where he indicated to you
4 that the problem was solved and on to the next issue?
5 A	No.	No.	His -- no.	My conversations with Ti m
6 Morrison have been primarily, in particular since then, since
7 the aid was released, on China.	He was very concerned about
8 China's investments in Ukraine, so we've had many
9 conversations about that.
10 Q	Okay.	So you still talk with Mr. Morrison with
11 some regularity?
12 A	I do.
13 Q	When did the fact tha t there was a complaint lodged
14 about these matters come to your attention?


15 A

16 Q

I'm not sure, Mr. Castor.
The whistleblower complaint, when did that first

17 come to your attention?
18 A	The whistleblower complaint?
19 Q	Yeah.

20 A
21 Q

I guess when I read it in the paper.
Okay.	Which was towards the end of September or

22 before i t was made public?
23 A	No, no, no.	In the newspape r.
24 Q	Okay.	Did anyone try to contact you to find out
25 any information, any firsthand information?

236


A	No.
2 Q	Okay.
3 A	No.
4 Q	How frequently do you have conversations with the
5 DNI about these issues?	Any?
6 A	I think none.
7 Q	Okay.	Does a person by the name of Eric Ciaramella
8 ring a bell for you?
9 A	It doesn't.
10 Q	So, to your knowledge, you never had any
I 1	communications with somebody by that name?
12 A	Correct.
13 Q	After the aid was released, did you ever have a
14 close-the-loop session with Volker and Sondland?
15 A	About that topic?
16 Q	Yes.
17 A	I don't think so.
18 Q	Okay.	So, once the aid was released, it was sort
19 of

20 A

21 Q

22 A
23 Q

That was my big concern. Okay.
Right.
The telephone conversation that Sondland relate s,

24 talking to the President, was pretty definitive, was it not?
25 A	I think so.	It is the one we're talking about that




237


he relates he had with the President --
2 Q	Right.
3 A	-- and then Morrison also re ports on that same
4 conversation, I think.
5 Q	Right.
6 A	That's right.	Yes.
7 Q	And Morrison's view of that conversation is
8 slightly different than Sondland's, is it not?
9 A	It could well be.
10 So I'm looking at, what, page 12 here.	He described a
II phone call earlier in the day between Sandland and Trump.
12 Sinking feeling from Ambassador Sandland.
13 So tha t may answer this question earlier about whether
14 he was on it.
15 Q	Yeah.
16 A	According to Morrison, President Trump asking for a
17 quid pro quo -- was not asking.	Did insist that President
18 Zelensky go to a microphone.
19 And then Sandland and I spoke on the phone.	He said he
20 talked to President Trump.	Adamant Zelensky himself had to
21 clear things up.	The same comment about no quid pro quo.
22 Sandland said he talked to the President and then he talked
23 to Zelensky and Yermak after that.
24 Q	Uh-huh.
25 A	So it sounds li ke they're talking about the same

238


phone call.
2 Q	What was the sinking feeling?
3 A	Thi s was a comment that Mr. Morrison made when he

4 heard that there were a Sondland-Pr esi dent Trump phone call,
5 and that gave him a sinking feeli ng.	And I think what he
6 meant by that was, he recogni zed that that channel -- that's
7 the irregular channel I've been talking about all day	has
8 the potent i al to be counte r to the regular chann el.	And
9 whenever he heard that there was an activation of that
IO	irregular channel, you know, he was concerned.
II	Q	Okay.	How frequent ly, to your knowledge, was
12 Sondland in d i scussi on with the President?
13 A	Thi s is a good question.	Ambassado r Sondland will
14 tell you, has told you, told me:	frequently .	Frequen tly.	I
15 mean, I can't -- I don't know.
16 I know for a fact that he can call the Pres i dent
17 directly and does.	And I've known this has	I have heard
18 that on severa l occasions he had done that, so i t's not just
19 a one-off.	I mean, he's done it a bunch -- a couple times
20 that I know of.
21 Q	Okay.	So i t's a regular enough occurrence that
22 he's probably talked to the President 10,	20,	30 ti mes?
23 A	I have no idea of the number.
24 Q	Okay.
25 There's a li ttle bit of a disconnect between -- like,

239


right around this time period is when Sondland reports the
2 President is pretty definitive, "I don't want anything.	I
3 want nothing."	But right at the same time, Morrison is
4 revealing that he has a sinking feel i ng.
5 And so I'm just curious as to how you piece those two
6 together.	Because, on one hand, the President says, I want
7 nothing, then the aid's released; but, on the other hand,
8 Morrison has the sinking feeling.
9 A	Morrison's sinking feeling is anytime there is an
10 activation of that ki nd of Giuliani-oriented channel.
11 Q	Uh-huh.
12 A	But it seems to me that they describe the -- it
13 seems to me that they describe the same phone call.	You're
14 right, there was some variance.

15 Q

16 A

Right.
And both related that the President said no quid

17 pro quo.	But they also both related that President Trump did
18 insist that Zelensky go to a microphone and open
19 investigations of Biden and 2016, and President Zelensky
20 should want to do it himself, and
21 Q	But that part's not from Sondland's readout of the
22 call.
23 A	This is Morrison telling me about a Sondland-Trump
24 meeting
25 Q	Okay.





240


A	phone call.	Right?	And then Sondland -- Gordon
2 tells me the next day, on September 8th, that he talked to
3 President Trump -- it must have been the day before -- and
4 that Trump was adamant that President Zelensky himself
5 Q	Uh-huh.
6 A	Because a week earlier, I had suggested to Gordon
7 that maybe the prosecutor general could make this statement;
8 it would be more logical than the President.
9 Q	But, in any event, you' re only hearing this from
10 either Sandland or Morrison, and you have no idea whether
II	these calls actually happened.
12 A	I think they actually happened, just because I got
13 two reports of what sounded like the same call.


14 Q

15 A

16 Q

Okay.	But by
But it's true that I never talked to the President. Okay.	But by September 9th, there had been some --

17 I mean, it had become public, ri ght, with the Politico story
18 that the aid was bei ng withheld?

19AThat was August 29th.20QRight.	So by September 9 --21ACorrect, it was out there.22Q-- on the eve of the aid hold being lifted -23AYep.24Q-- it had been public.25AFor a week, week and a half.
241


Q	Ri ght.
2 A	Yeah.
3 Q	And, as we understand it, there were Senators, you
4 know, calli ng the
5 A	Two Senators came up.	Oh.	Right, right.	You're
6 exactly right.	Senators called the President.	Yes.
7 Q	Okay.	So it's possible Sondland -- when Sondland
8 says the President doesn' t want anything, no quid pro quo,
9 it's possible the Presi dent's reacting to the fact that he's
10 getting some heat on this issue and he's about to lift the
1 I	hold.

12 A
13 Q

I don't know. Okay.

14 A	Don't know.
I 5	MR. MEADOWS:	So I wanted a few clarifications -
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Please.
17 MR. MEADOWS -- because sometimes my ears - -
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I have the same problem. I have the
19 same problem.
20 MR. MEADOWS:	So are you saying you got a call about the
21 Sondland-Trump phone call from Morrison
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
23 MR. MEADOWS:	-- before you did from Sondland?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.	I got the Morrison call on
25 the 7th, and I got --

242



MR. MEADOWS:	Is that unusual, I mean, that you would
2 get a report from the NSC on a phone call between an
3 Ambassado r and the President of the United States before you
4 got a readout from the Ambassador or to the President?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Congressman, i t's just a matter of
6 logistics of when you're on what call.
7 MR. MEADOWS:	Yeah, but I guess the question I have is,
8 does Morrison report on other phone calls between the
9 President and other individuals to you?	I just find that
10 just interesting, that he would pick up the phone and call
11 you and say "by the way" about this readout between a phone
12 call and the President before Ambassador Sondland did that.
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: It was before.	There' s no doubt it
14 was before Ambassador Sondland did that.	That's clear from
15 the 7th and 8th of September.
16 But Tim Morrison and I have a lot of i nteract i ons that I
17 just mentioned to Mr. Castor, and I may have called him with
18 some other que sti ons about, I don't know, China, and he may
19 have related that.	So it was not a regular -- I don't
20 remember any other time when he related a conversation about
21 the President.
22 MR. MEADOWS:	So, obviously, this would've been a big
23 deal, this phone call, I mean. with the President saying, no
24 quid pro quo.	Did you have a relief at that point that,
25 well, gosh, since there's no quid pro quo, I guess the funds




243



are going to be released?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That was not my reaction at the
3 time, Congressman.	My --
4 MR. MEADOWS:	Well, what was your reaction?	Because I
5 guess I'm a little -- I mean , if this is such a big deal --
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: It is a big --
7 MR. MEADOWS:	that you raised it with a Ukrainian
8 official on September 1st --
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
10 MR. MEADOWS:	-- why would you have not reacted in a
11 more, I guess, exuberant manner?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	To the statement that I heard twice,
13 that it was not a qu i d pro quo?	Is that --
14 MR. MEADOWS:	Right.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I should've been exuberant about
16 that?	Oh, because -- I'm just trying to understand your
17 quest i on. And so
18 MR. MEADOWS:	Yeah.	No, that's the question.	You
19 understand it.	I guess I find it that it was just very blase
20 that you got a phone call
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I
22 MR. MEADOWS:	-- when you had raised this, and you
23 di dn' t --
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	Please let the witness answer.
2 5	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The answer, Congressman, is that --

244



MR. MEADOWS:	Adam, I have not interrupted you at all
2 today.
3 THE CHAIRMA N:	I know, but he's try i ng to answer three
4 ti mes in a row.
5 MR. MEADOWS:	I'm trying to clari fy my question.	He's
6 asked me two or three tim es.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And I thi nk I got the que sti on now.
8 Thank you.
9 MR. MEADOWS:	Okay.
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Thank you, Congressman.
I I	So the answer is that, even after the statement that I
12 heard both times from both recollections. recitations,
13 descriptions of the phone call. after the quid pro quo, the re
14 is none. there is none, the re is none, then it went on --
15 both conversations went on to say:	But President Tr ump did
16 insist that President Zelensky go to a mi crophone and say he
17 is opening investigations of Biden and 2016, and President
18 Zelensky should want to do this himself.	That was the --
19 that's what Ti m
20 MR. MEADOWS:	And that came from Morrison?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That came from Morr i son.
22 MR. MEADOWS:	Okay.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: What came from Sandland when he told
24 me this story was President Trump said it was not a quid pro
25 quo.	Ambassador Sandland said that he had talked to

245



President Zelensky and Yermak and told them that, although
2 this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not
3 clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate.
4 MR. MEADOWS:	All right.
5 And so let me go back to one other thing, because I
6 think you said -- you've said it twice now, and I want to
7 make sure I understand you.	You do not think it's
8 appropriate for the Ukraine Government to investigate a
9 violation of Ukrainian law.	Is that what you said?
IO	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, no.	I think it's perfectly
II appropriate for the Ukrainian Government to investigate a
12 violation of Ukrainian law.	I think it's --
13 MR. MEADOWS:	Okay.	All right.	I thought so.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah, yeah.
15 MR. MEADOWS:	All ri ght.
16 So one other area.	You talked about -- and I think it
17 was Mr. Noble had asked you about the funds being withheld.
18 and you said you believed that it was the aid and foreign
19 military sales as well, all together in one bunch, in answer
20 to his question.
21 And I want to remind you, actually , the talk of the
22 Javelins and foreign military sales, it comes at a separate
23 time.	And I want to refresh your memory on that and perhaps
24 allow you --
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	You're --

246




2
Mr.MR. MEADOWS:	-- to correct the record.	Because I think
Noble asked the que sti on and you lumped it all together3andsaid it came at one time4AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No --5MR. MEADOWS:	-- and we know that that's not accurate.6AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Let me tell you what I think is
7 accurate.
8 MR. MEADOWS:	Okay.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	What I think is accurate is there
10 was 250 million in something called the Ukraine Security
11 Assistance Initiative, USA!.	And that
12 MR. MEADOWS:	Controlled by DOD.
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	-- is owned by DOD, correct.
14 MR. MEADOWS:	That's correct.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.	And there's another
16 141 million of, I think i t's FMF that's run by the State
17 Department.
18 MR. MEADOWS:	State Department.
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is separate from -- those two
20 things are separate from the purchase of Javelins by the
21 Ukrainians with their own money --
22 MR. MEADOWS:	That's correct.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	-- of about $29 million for about
24 150 J aveli ns, right?	So those are three separate pieces.	If
25 I was not clear on that --

247



MR. MEADOWS:	Yeah.	Because they came in thre e separate
2 tranches.	And I used to be on Foreign Affairs, and when we
3 talk about all of this stuff, there's a whole lot of things
4 that hold up forei gn aid.
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
6 MR. MEADOWS:	And so you're a career Foreign Service --
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am actually not a career Foreign
8 Service, but I've been in the State Department for a long
9 time.
10 MR. MEADOWS:	Well, you've been in the State Department
II	for a long time.
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That' s correct.
13 MR. MEADO WS:	And so have you seen aid held up for a
14 variety of reasons other than just a norma l appropriations
15 glitch?	Have you seen Senators put a hold on foreign aid
16 occasionally --
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes.
18 MR. MEADOWS:	-- to get votes on things that -
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don' t know about getting votes on
20 things.	But, sure, there are certainly holds put on foreign
21 assistance packages.	Ther e's no doubt about it.
22 MR. MEADOWS:	That have nothing to do with our overall
23 foreign poli cy i ni ti ati ve.	Have you seen that?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't remember, but I would not be
25 surpr i sed. I would not be surprised.

248


MR. MEADOWS:	All right .
2 MR. JORDAN:	Ambassador, how many conversations and/or
3 meetings did you have with Mr. Morrison in this relevant time
4 period?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	"Relevant time" meaning all summer?
6 MR. JORDAN:	Well, you said you had one -- you get there
7 on June 17th and you had one conversati on with the individual
8 who held Mr. Morrison's position at NSC.	You had one
9 conversation in your first month there, and it was on
10 Ju ly 19th.
II	So, between July 19th and the September timeframe when
12 Mr . Morrison calls you to tell you about a call that
13 Mr. Sandland had with the President of the United States, how
14 many ti mes between July 19th and September 9th, roughly , how
15 many times did you communicate with Mr. Morrison?	It sounds
16 like it was a lot.
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.	I was going to say 8, 10, 12.
18 A good number .	A lot.
19 MR. JORDAN:	Yeah.	So his predecessor you had one
20 conversation with in this timeframe.
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Well, no.	I actually had -- before
22 I went out, I sat down with Fiona and Alex -- actually, a
23 couple times before I went out.	And then had this meeti ng
24 or had this call
25 MR. J ORDAN: Well, earlier, in a previous hour, when I




249


asked you how many conversations you had wi th Dr. Hill
2 between J une 17th and July 19th, you sai d one, and that was
3 on J uly 19th.
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And I thi nk that's correct.	And
5 what I'm saying is before I --
6 MR. JOR DAN:	And we tried to establish - - it sounded
7 like it was on your calendar.	She probably called you, but
8 you weren't sure.	Am I characterizing that accura tely?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
10 MR. JOR DAN:	So you had one conversation with Dr. Hi ll
11 in your first month on the job.
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I thi nk that's correct, yes.
13 MR. JOR DAN:	And now you've said you had multiple
14 conversati ons with Mr. Morrison.
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
16 MR. J ORDAN:	Okay.	Thi s one that was in your testimony,
17 was thi s Mr. Morri son called you to tell you about that, or
18 was it his previously scheduled call?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	We're talking about September 7th
20 now, Congressman?
21 MR. J ORDAN:	Let me just go back and look.	Yeah, the
22	September 7th -- you described a phone conversation between
23 Ambassador Sondland and President Trump.	Did he call you?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The way we do these phone call s is,
25 to be secure, to be secure -- September 7th may be a -- was

250


it a Sunday?	September 7th.	It was a Saturday.	So to have
2 a secure call on a weekend, I go into the Embassy.
3 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And the way we arrange these calls
5 is through unclass email.	We say, Tim, you know, you got
6 time?	Or he may have sent me a note saying, do we have time?
7 And I'd said, sure, I'll go into the Embassy at such and such
8 a time.
9 So the short answer is I'm not sure who called whom.
10 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	But you had multiple calls between
II	July 19th and this call on September 7th.
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
13 MR. JORDAN:	And did you have a prior friendship or
14 relat i onshi p working with Mr. Morrison prior to his time as
15 coming in --
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, I had not met him before.
17 MR. JORDAN:	So you'd never met him before.
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
19 MR. JORDAN:	He gets Dr. Hill's position.
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
21 MR. JORDAN:	And then you have multiple phone calls with
22 him in thi s timeframe.
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
24 MR. JORDAN:	And I think you said some of it was
25 relative to China.	And Ukraine as well?	The linkage




251



AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
2 MR. JORDAN:	-- between China and Ukraine?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, China in Ukraine.
4 MR. JORDAN:	I understand.
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	China i nvesti ng in -- yes.
6 MR. J ORDAN:	Okay.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah, he's very -- he and
8 Dr. Kupperman and many people, as you are I'm sure aware, are
9 concerned about the Chinese i ntere st i n buying up some of
10 Ukrainian technology and a company called	Yes.
II	So we had many conversations about that.
12 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	And of these multiple conversations,
13 many conversations you had, do you think it's - - characterize
14 it.	Was it more Mr. Morrison reach in g out to you to
15 communicate information to you or the other way?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Both.
17 MR. JORDAN:	Who initiated?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It's both.
19 MR. JORDAN:	Who initiated most?	I'm just curious.
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm just
21 MR. JORDAN:	You don't know?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Both.	I don't know.
23 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	Thank you.
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It's some of each.
25 MR. J ORDAN: All right.





252


MR. MEADOWS:	And so this phone call you had was on a
2 Saturday.
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	September 7th I thi nk was a
4 Saturday.
5 MR. MEADOWS:	So how many times do you go in to make
6 phone calls on urgent matters on a Saturday?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not i nfrequen tly, sadly.
8 MR. MEADOWS:	So you literally say, well, I need to go
9 talk to Washington, D.C., and go in on a Saturday --
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	If it has to be secure, yes, I go
11 into the Embassy.	And the Embassy is 25 minutes away.
12 MR. MEADOWS:	No, I get the secure nature, but -
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.
14 MR. MEADOWS:	So what you're saying is you go into the
15 Embassy to make this phone call to talk about a phone call
16 that he had with the President.
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: That he had it
18 MR. ME ADOWS:	Sandland had it with the President.
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Right.	Morrison is talking about a
20 Sandland conversation with the President, correct.
21 MR. MEADOWS:	Okay.	And so, as you go in -- you don't
22 recall what else you talked about?
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	In that phone call?
24 MR. MEADOWS:	Yeah.
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't.

253


BY MR. CASTOR:
2 Q	You fi rst learned you were going to be coming here
3 today to answer questions last week?	Or before?
4 A	No, no, no.	You sent me -- somebody sent me a note
5 or an i nvi tati on to come probably 2 weeks ago?
6 Q	Okay.
7 A	Yeah.
8 Q	But pri or to today, have you had any communications
9 with congressional staff about any of the issues that we've
10 discussed here today?
11 A	No.
12 Q	Okay.	And, you know, there was a report running
13 yesterda y about things tha t may or may not have occurred on a
14 codel, and I just want to --
15 A	Staffdel, maybe.	Was it a staffdel?
16 Q	Codel or staffdel.

17 A

18 asking.

So I saw a report.	Maybe thi s is what you're

19 Whi le I was in Kyiv -- this must've been -- maybe about
20 the same ti me.	I can't remember.	In September.	The
21 Atlantic Council had one of its many vi si ts, and the Atlan ti c
22 Counc i l invites congressi onal staff.	Generally, they are
23 fairly junior congressi onal staff.	And I thi nk there were
24 probab ly 15 or so congressi onal staffers on this tri p.
25 John Herbst, Ambassador Herbst organizes these.	It was

254


a Sunday afternoon.	They were just off the plane.	They came
2 to my residence, and I gave them a bri efi ng.	And it could've
3 been that one of your staffers was on thi s, Mr. Chairman.
4 Q	My question was just simply, you haven't had
5 communications with --
6 A	I have not.
7 Q	-- congressional staff outside of what we're here
8 doing here today?
9 A	That's right.	Other -- if the question is about
10 that Atlantic Council one, there were a bunch of
11 congressional staffers whom I gave a regular briefing to.
12 Q	Okay.	Fair enough.
13 What else -- what can you tell us about the Atlantic
14 Counc i l?	Did you know they were funded i n part by Burisma?
15 A	You know, I di dn't know that.	I didn't know that.
16 So I have great respect for the people -- I know a lot of the
17 people at the Atlantic Council.	And I know that -- and I
18 know that they have to raise funds.	I didn't know that
19 Burisma was one of their funders.
20 Q	Okay.	But you learned tha t recently or -- 21		A	Maybe in the past week.
22 Q	Do a lot of Ukrainian business enter pri ses
23 contribute money to the Atlantic Counci l, to your knowledge?
24 A	I don't know.
25 MR. CASTOR:	Mr. Armstrong, did you have something you

255


wanted to --
2 MR. ARMSTRONG:	Yeah, just briefly.
3 You were talking about the High Court of
4 Anti-Corruption.	And that was actually set up under
5 Poroshenko, but it was inactive.	And when Zelensky got
6 elected, he brought it back, right?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.	"Inactive" is probably
8 well, it wasn't put into effect.	It wasn't	it didn't
9 start.	And the problem was, it didn't have a place to meet.
10 And so -- under President Poroshenko.	And so people were
II	thinking that he was kind of dragging his feet.
12 MR. ARMSTRONG:	Yeah.
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And then Zelensky gets in, and
14 within, like, 2 weeks, the same fellow, this prosecutor
15 general that I mentioned a minute ago, Ryabshapka, came up
16 with a place, got them in, and they opened it on
17	September 5th.
18 MR. ARMSTRONG:	But earlier in your testimony, you
19 said	we had a comment about Parliament, and you said you
20 can buy your way into Parliament.	We asked about criminal
21 justi ce.	You can buy your way out of prosecution essentially
22 is going on.
23 And there were actually -- you had talked earli er about
24 concerns about Zelensky's relationship with a particular
25 oligarch.	There were concerns about the Naftogaz board, the

256


boards of state-owned banks. and. obviously, even outside of
2 all of this. some questions about Burisma and what we just
3 found out.
4 And corruption relating to oligarchs is not something
5 new, correct?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
7 MR. ARMSTRONG:	I mean -- and during this, we went
8 through it.	I mean. there was a parliamentarian. Leshchenko.
9 who was investigated.	You said he was an original supporter
IO	of Zelensky and then wasn't?
II	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	So he was originally -- well, he
12 started off as a journalist.	He joined President
13 Poroshenko's party and was elected to Parliament.	And then.
14 as a reformer, he was advising the Zelensky campaign,
15 self-selected out of the Zelensky camp.
16 MR. ARMSTRONG:	And people were excited about Zelensky's
17 election. but also. at the same time -- and I'll get back to
18 this in a second -- I mean, there was at least four current
19 or former members of the Ukrainian Government that were, I
20 mean, participating in our 2016 election.	And I don't mean
21 anything -- I mean. they were posting on Facebook, whether it
22 was former Prime Minister Yatseniuk was posting on Facebook;
23 Minister of Internal Affairs -- who is still a member of
24 government, correct.
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.




257


MR. ARMSTRONG:	-- Avakov, who has, I mean, said some
2 pretty de rogatory things about the President.	Chaly, who was
3 the Ambassador to Ukraine, coined an op-ed in The Hill during
4 the campaign.
5 So we have a concern about a potential relationship with
6 Zelensky.	We have -- I mean , this is systemic, and it's gone
7 on for a long tim e.
8 So, I mean, while we're exc i ted and this is moving
9 forward and some of these thi ngs are going on, you can see
10 probably how this administration maybe had a little concern,
II	particularly not only with corruption but also with di rect
12 relationship to wha t went on with --
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, the only thing I'd say
14 is that the concern should not have been about the new team.
15 Now, your point is a good one -- that is, they had one
16 carryover from --
17 MR. ARMSTRONG:	Well, let me ask you thi s.	Because you
18 weren't the Ambassador during the 2016 election.
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: That's true .
20 MR. ARMSTRONG:	But you were the Ambassador during the
21 2008 election.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I was.
23 MR. ARMSTRONG:	And if four members of the Ukrainian
24 Government were directly involved i n the election of -- which
25 ended up being President Obama, in your position of

258



Ambassador, how would you have handled tha t?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: What would I have done to -- so the
3 scenario is --
4 MR. ARMSTRONG:	Let me ask -- let's start here:	Would
5 that have concerned you?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Any interference of diplomats or of
7 government officials in an electi on in another country would
8 concern me.
9 MR. ARMSTRONG:	So I'm assuming none of tha t happened i n
10	2008.
11 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not that I know of.
12 MR. ARMSTRONG:	Any Ukra i ni an officials that you're
13 aware of.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not that I'm aware of.
15 MR. ARMSTRONG:	Okay.	Thanks.
16 MR . CASTOR:	I think our time has expir ed.
17 THE CHAIRMA N:	Let's take a 5- or 10-minute break.	We
18 do have votes coming up.	It would be my intention for staff
19 to continue the interview during votes.	And I don't thi nk we
20 have a lot more questions for you.	I don't know where the
21 minority is, but hopefully we won't go too much longer.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm at your service, Mr. Chairman.
23 THE CHAIRMA N:	Okay.	Thank you, Ambassador.
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Thank you.
25 [ Recess .]

259



[5:31 p.m.]
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	We're going to go back on the record to
3 try to get to as many members as we can before votes.	And
4 let me start by recognizing Mr. Malinowski.
5 MR. MALINOWSKI:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
6 Thank you, Ambassador, for your service and your
7 patience with us today.	I just wanted -- you've answered
8 most of my questions, so I wanted to maybe try to sum things
9 up a little bit.	It seems to me from your testimony and from
10 that of others that we've heard that there was a group of
11 officials in the executive branch who were working on Ukraine
12 and who cared about Ukraine across the i nteragency .
13 And at the start of this drama, all of you basically
14 agreed on the objective, supporting Ukraine against Russia,
15 fighting corruption, promoting democracy.	You wanted a good
16 relationship between the two countries.	And then, at a
17 certain point, you all learned that the President was in a
18 different place, correct?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	So, in the May 23rd, before I
20 got out there, in his meeting with the delegation that came
21 back enthusiastic about Zelensky, the President was less
22 enthusiastic.
23 MR. MALINOWSKI:	Right.	And at that point, things
24 that group of people, roughly speaking, split into two
25 different camps.	You all still had the same goals, but there

260


was one group of folks who felt that they didn't want to have
2 anything to do with what Mr. Bolton reportedly described as
3 the drug deal because it was wrong, it was unprincipled, we
4 should not be operating that way.
5 And then there was a second group of people that may
6 have included Kurt Volker, Ambassador Sandland, Secretary
7 Perry, who decided that they had to somehow go along with
8 this drug deal because they felt it was the only way to bring
9 the President back, to get him to support the vision of the
10 relationship that you wanted.	Is that a fair assessment? II		AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It is, Congressman.	And it was
12 motivated, but as you said, toward a strong relationship.	It
13 was just a different -- they thought they had to take a
14 different route through Giuliani to get there.
15 MR. MALINOWSKI:	Right.	And so the problem wasn' t with
16 either of those groups of people.	The problem was the drug
17 deal itself, in effect.	It was this decision that, you know,
18 you had to go through this path to get to that outcome.	And
19 so let me ask you, who was responsible for the drug deal?
20 Who was responsi ble for setting all this into motion?	Was it
21 Mr. Sandland?	Was it Ambassador Sandland?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't think so.	I th i nk the
23 origin of the idea to get President Zelensky to say out loud
24 he's going to investigate Burisma and 2016 election, I think
25 the originator, the person who came up with that was




261


Mr. Giuliani.
2 MR. MALI NOWSKI:	And he was representing whose interests
3 in
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	President Trump.
5 MR. MALINOWSKI:	Thank you.
6 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Krishnamoorthi.
7 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Hello, Mr. Ambassador.
8 Thank you for your incredible service to our Nation.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you, sir.
10 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	First of all, on page 12 of your
II	statement, you talked about the meeting that you helped
12 facilitate between Senators Johnson and Murphy with President
13 Zelensky.	Do you recall that meeting?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
15 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	And in your statement, you say that
16 they emphasized that President Zelensky should not jeopardize
17 bipartisan support by getting drawn into U.S. domestic
18 politics.	What exactly were they referring to when they said
19 he should not jeopardize bipartisan support by getting drawn
20 into U.S. politics?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The Senators were concerned -- the
22 Senators could see that President Zelensky faced a dilemma,
23 and the dilemma was investigate Burisma and 2016 or don' t.
24 And if they investigated, then that would be seen to be
25 i nterferin g on the side of President Trump's reelection; if

262


they didn't investigate, that would be seen to be interfering
2 in favor of some of his -- of President Trump 's opponent.	So
3 they told him:	Just don't get involved, just don't get
4 involved.
5 MR. MALINOWSKI:	And both Senator Murphy and Senator
6 Johnson said -- or expressed that sentiment, correct?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I want to be careful about quoting
8 Members of Congress and Senators.	This is why I was
9 counseled by smarter people than I about how to phrase this.
10 But that was spoken by Senator Murphy.
II	MR. MALINOWSKI:	Okay.	And, now, some folks might say
12 that the beginning of those i nvest i gati ons was merely
13 inv esti gati ng cor rupti on.	Why was it your and their
14 sentiment that it was actually getting Zelensky drawn into
15 U.S. poli tics?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It would get into U.S. politics if
17 the Ukrainians were to go -- was to investigate the Burisma
18 cases that were closed at the time when Vice President Biden
19 was in town -- in Kyiv frequently making the point about
20 anticorruption and when his son was on the board of Burisma.
21 So it was that cluster of issues surrounding Burisma that
22 would be highlighted by an investigation.
23 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	And you agreed with the sentiment
24 expressed by the Senators, correct?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I did.

263



MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Now, let me turn your attention to
2 page 8 for a second.	There?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yep.
4 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Ambassador Sandland said that
5 I'm looking at the top of the page -- said that a call
6 between President Trump and President Zelensky would take
7 place soon.	This is in the July timeframe.	And Ambassador
8 Volker said that what was, quote, most important for Zelensky
9 to say that he will help investigation and address any
10 specific personnel issues if there are any, closed quote.
II	What specific personnel issues are being referred to?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I don't know.	To this
13 day, I don' t know what he was referring to there.
14 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Okay.	And did Ambassador Sandland
15 ever bring up personnel issues?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not in my -- not that I know of.
17 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Finally, Giuliani.	You may or may
18 not be aware of this, but Giuliani had a hand in trying to
19 force out Ambassador Yovanovitch from her post as Ambassador.
20 Are you aware of any attempts by Giuliani or anyone else to
21 come back at you for some of the text messages that you had
22 sent basically questioning the wisdom of Ukraine policy that
23 was being pursued by Volker, Sandland, Giuliani, or anyone
24 else?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, sir.

264



MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	And did anybody ever question you
2 directly about your statements and whether you were somehow
3 out of line in making the statements that you made?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not yet.
5 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Okay.	Thank you.	I hope never.
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you.
7 MR. KRISHNAMOORTHI:	Do me a favo r though:	Stay honest
8 as you are.	Thank you, sir.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you, sir.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	Ju st one followup question before I go to
ti	my next colleague.	Prior to the codel you mentioned with
12 Senators Murphy and Johnson, Senator Johnson told The Wall
13 Street Journal that Sandland had described to him a quid pro
14 quo i nvolv i ng a commitment by Kyiv to probe matters related
15 to U.S. elections and the status of nea rly $400 million in
16 U.S. aid to Ukraine that the Pres i dent had ordered to be held
17 up in July.
18 Apparently, Senator Johnson had told this to the Journal
19 before the codel.	Did he ever raise this with you during
20 those meet i ngs?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He didn't raise that, no,
22 Mr. Chairman.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Representative Lynch.	Then
24 Maloney and Spei er , i f you have questi ons, Spei er , J acki e
25 Speier.

265



MR. LYNCH:	Thank you.	Thank you, Ambassador.	I really
2 appreciate your courage in coming forward, and thank you for
3 your service.
4 I'd like you to focus on page 10 and 11 of your opening
5 statement.	And September 1st seems to be a red letter day,
6 so to speak.	You have a conversation -- excuse me, yeah, you
7 have a number of conversations here that are very important.
8 One you had with Mr. Morrison, who described a
9 conversation between Ambassador Sandland with Mr. Yermak at
10 Warsaw, where Ambassador Sandland told Mr. Yermak that the
II	security assistance money would not come until Presi dent
12 Zelensky commits to pursue the Burisma investigation.
13 You also say that's the first time you've heard that
14 security assistance, not just the White House meeting, was
15 conditioned on the investigation.	And then you text message
16 Ambassador Sandland, and you' re saying	it's a question:
17 We are now saying the security assistance and the White House
18 meeting are conditioned on i nvest i gati ons, question mark, end
19 quote.
20 There's also a statement here that you relate that
21 Ambassador Sandland also told you that he now recognized he'd
22 made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to
23 whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President
24 Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of
25 investigations, in fact.	Ambassador Sandland said everything

266



was dependent on such an announcement, including security
2 assistance.
3 He said the Presi dent -- Trump wanted President
4 Zelensky, quote, in a public box, close quote, by maki ng a
5 public statement about ord eri ng such investigations.	This is
6 a ri ch description.	This is all one day, September 1st.	And
7 so I would li ke to know, is this a product of your memo ry, or
8 is this something tha t you took contemporaneous notes, you
9 know, at the time that this was occurring?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Contemporan eous notes, Mr. Lynch.
II	MR. LYNCH: They are.	And that i s your usual practice?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It is, indeed.
13 MR. LYNCH:	And did you surrender these notes to the
14 State Department?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I did.
16 MR. LYNCH: You did?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I did.
18 MR. LYNCH:	And do you have copies in your custody?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
20 MR. LYNCH:	You do.	Okay.	That's all I got.	I yield
21 back.
22 THE CHAIRMA N:	Mr. Maloney.
23 MR. MALONEY:	Ju st a quick followup on that one point.
24 Over here.	My name is Sean Maloney.	Ambassador Sandland ,
25 thank you for your testim ony today.




267


Just to follow up on my colleague's ques ti on, along
2 those same lines, when you use quotation marks in your
3 opening statement, did you have a standard that you applied?
4 In other words, would we fi nd those phrases, those quo tes in
5 the notes you just descr i bed to my colleague, Mr. Lynch?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes, sir .	If I had them -- if I put
7 them in quotation marks, that means I can find them in my
8 notes.	And I took notes	it would ei ther be in a text
9 message or WhatsApp message or notes that I took on my li ttle
10 notebook that I carry around, or a notebook that I keep in my
11 office that I take notes on phone calls when I'm in the
12 offi ce.	So the answer i s, yes, if I've got quotes on them, I
13 can fi nd them.
14 MR. MALONEY:	Thank you.
15 I want to di rect your attenti on to page 10.	I just have
16 a couple of que sti ons about the Warsaw meeting.
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
18 MR. MAL ONEY:	Now, we see towards the bottom of page 10
19 you describe the meeti ng that Vice President Pence had with
20 President Zelensky.	I believe that was on September 1st?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
22 MR. MALONEY:	And in that fourth paragraph towards the
23 bottom, you mentioned tha t whi le Presi dent Zelensky, and I'm
24 quoting, had opened the meeting by asking the Vice Presi dent
25 about security cooperation, you go on to say, the Vice

268


President did not respond substanti vely but said he would
2 talk to President Trump that night.
3 Do you see where I'm reading from?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
5 MR. MAL ONEY :	Do you know whether the Vice President
6 spoke to the President that night?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't.
8 MR. MALONEY:	And then you also go on to say, the Vice
9 President did not say the President wanted the Europeans to
10 do -- excuse me, the Vi ce Presi den t did say that President II	Trump wanted the Europeans to do more to support the Ukraine
12 and that he wanted the Ukrainian s to do more to fight
13 corruption.
14 In the next paragraph, however, you describe another
15 meeting that's going on also i n Warsaw, also the same day, as
16 I understand it, between Ambassador Sandland and Mr. Yermak.
17 Is that right?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	This is a report of a phone call I
19 had with Mr. Morri son.	I think it's the same one that we
20 just -- I thi nk he called me to tell me about or I called him
21 to ask about the events in Warsaw on September 1st.
22 MR. MAL ON EY:	And --
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I'm sorry, Congressman.	This is the
24 same phone call with Mr. Morrison.	He went on to describe
25 this subsequent conversation with Sandland, Yer mak.




269


MR. MALONEY:	I think I understand your answer, sir.
2 But my question is, is in the phone call you're having with
3 Mr. Morrison --
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And he's describing a Warsaw meeting
5 between Mr. Sondland and Mr. Yermak
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
7 MR. MALONEY:	which seems to have happened at the
8 same time as the Vice Presi den t was meeting with President
9 Zelensky.	Am I correct?
IO	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It was the same event, but
I I	probably -- I wasn't there, but what happens at these is
12 there's a bilateral meeting between Vice President and the
13 President with all the aides.	And then, after that, the
14 aides may get together separately, and that's what I imagine
15 happened here.
16 MR. MALONEY:	I understand.	Do you know whether
17 Ambassador Sondland ever spoke to the Vice President about
18 his conversation with Mr. Yermak?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know.
20 MR. MALONEY:	I want to ask you about one other thing,
21 sir, which is, on page 12 and on page 13, my colleague
22 Chairman Schiff has taken you at some length through the
23 various statements of conditionality and your view of tha t.
24 And it's not my i ntent i on to go back into that.	I just
25 wanted to ask you about the wording you use at this point in

270



the sequence of events.
2 So, on September 8th, there is the call between Sondland
3 and Volker and you, and you recount this expression about
4 how when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone
5 who owes him something, the businessman asks that person to
6 pay up before signing the check.	And then, of course, you
7 mention that Ambassador Volker used the same term several
8 days later.	Do you see where I'm reading from the from in
9 the middle of the page?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
11 MR. MALONEY:	And you go on to say that holding up
12 security assistance for -- and you use the words "domesti c
13 political gain" was, quote, cra zy.	Do you see that?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
15 MR. MALONEY:	And the day before -- excuse me, the day
16 after that. on September 9th. it comes before in your
17 testimony a couple paragraphs up, but it's actually the next
18 day is when you write the famous text:	I think it's crazy to
19 withhold security assistance for help with a political
20 campaign.	Do you see that?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
22 MR. MALONEY:	And so my question, sir, is, when you use
23 phrases like "domestic political gain" or a "poli ti cal
24 campaign," I want to understand what you meant by that,
25 because, of course, we're not just talking now about whether

271



or not an investigation was launched or whether or not it
2 would be appropriate or not to do that.	I'm curious about
3 why you connected it up to, quote, a domestic political gain
4 and, qu ote, a political campaign?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Because as I understood the reason
6 for investigating Burisma was to cast Vice President Biden in
7 a bad light.
8 MR. MALONEY:	That would be the domestic political gain?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
10 MR. MALONEY:	To cast Vice President Biden in a bad
II light?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Right.
13 MR. MALONEY:	And the political campaign would be what
14 political campaign?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	A political campaign for the
16 reelection of President Trump.
17 MR. MALONEY:	On page 2 of your testimony -- last
18 question.	On page 2 of your testimony, you say that Ukraine
19 was special, which struck me.	You talk about your many years
20 of service and the extraordinary work you've done for our
21 country, but in that third paragraph, you say:	Ukraine is
22 special for me.	Do you see that?	In fact, you say, across
23 the responsibilities I've had in public service, Ukraine is
24 special for me.	It's in the third paragraph, halfway
25 through.

272



AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	Yes, sir.
2 MR. MALONEY:	Throughout the day, you've responded to
3 our questions in a very professional manner.	I take it this
4 is your years of traini ng as a diplomat.	But I'm curious
5 about your emotional reaction to these events.	Ukraine, as
6 you say, was speci al to you, and you witnessed this over the
7 series of a couple of months this summer from June, I guess,
8 through the present, but really to early September,
9 especially.	What was your emotional reaction to these
10 events?
1 1	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR :	It was a reaction based on the fact
12 that, as I mentioned, either before or after that, just after
13 that, tha t I thi nk Uk rai ne is important objectively to the
14 United States.	That is not emoti onally, but we can do some
15 kind of analysis and determ i ne why it's im portan t for Ukraine
16 to succeed as a state and why i t's important for Russia not
17 to succeed in its aggression.	Tha t's kind of the analytic
18 piece.
19 The emotional piece is based on my time in Ukraine in
20 2006, 2009, when traveling around the country, I got to know
21 Ukrainians and their frustrat i ons and di ffi culti es and those
22 kind of things.	And then coming back and seeing it now where
23 they have the opportunity, they've got a young President, a
24 young Prime Minister, a young Parliament, the Prime Minister
25 is 35 years old.	This new government has appealed to young




273



people who are so idealistic, pro-West, pro-United States,
2 pro-Europe, that I feel an emotional attachment, bond,
3 connection to this country and these people.
4 MR. MALONEY:	You cared about it?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I cared about this country.
6 MR. MALONEY:	And you di dn 't want to see it screwed up?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I di dn' t want to see it screwed up.
8 I wanted to see it succeed.
9 MR. MALONEY:	And you d i dn' t want to see it screwed up
IO	by some poli ti cal agenda coming from Washington.	Is that
II	fair to say?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Well, what I di dn't want to do is
13 have United States assistance to Ukraine blocked or suspended
14 for no good reason that I could see.	And there are some bad
15 reasons that -- I didn't want to see that blocked.	That was
16 my concern, in thi s episode.
17 MR. MALONEY:	Thank you, si r.
18 THE CHAIRMA N:	Just one followup question before I go to
19 Repre senta ti ve Speier.	In Warsaw, Morrison relates to you
20 there are two meetings going on.	There is a meeting with a
21 Vice President and President Zelensky, and then there 's the
22 separate meeting between Sandland and Yermak, correct?
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct, and they're probably in
24 sequence.	They're probably not at the same time.
25 THE CHAIRMAN:	And the meeti ng with the Vice President

274


and Zelensky was actually a big meeting with one or two dozen
2 people.	Am I right?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Probably.	I was not there, but,
4 yes.	Normally that's the case.
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	So, at a big meeting like that, it stands
6 to reason they're not going to get into the specifics about
7 that we want you to do this poli ti cal investigation in order
8 to get this.	Am I right?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	That takes place, in fact, in this small,
11 private meeting between Sandland and Yermak?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes. without -- presumably without
13 the Vice President.

14 THE CHAIRMAN:
15 MS. SPEIER:

Okay.	Representative Speier.
Thank you.

16 Ambassador , thank you for really a li fetim e of service
17 to our country.	You're really a great American.
18 I've got a couple of kind of strings I'd li ke to just
19 get some clarification on.	You said that you met with
20 Ambassador Volker and Mr. Yermak over dinner on the 14th of
21	September after the money had been released.	And Mr. Volker
22 kept pushing, sayi ng, do not investigate Poroshenko.	Did you
23 have a subsequent conversation with him as to why he was
24 doing that?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	With Mr. Volker, no.	I wouldn't

275


characterize it, Ms. Speier, as saying that he -- or he kept
2 doing it.	I mean, he raised it once, got a pretty emotional
3 response or kind of, you know, a strong response from both
4 Ukrainians at the table.	And he d i dn' t push --
5 MS. SPEIER:	He backed off?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Kurt did not pursue it.
7 MS. SPEIER:	But you di dn' t ask him afterwards why he
8 was
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I di dn't.
10 MS. SPEIER:	Okay.	Did anyone in the Zelensky
II	administration indicate to you a sense of confusion with what
12 you have dubbed as the irregular policy channel?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Indirectly.	So, in my conversations
14 in the regular channel with President Zelensky and his team,
15 they would, on occasion, express confusion or uncertainty
16 about what direction they were getti ng from the United States
17 because they were hearing, as I mentioned earlier, directly
18 from Ambassador Sandland who could and would pick up the
19 phone and call President Zelensky or President -- Assistant
20 Yermak and give them advice outside of the normal channel
21 outside of my channel, outside of the normal channel.	So
22 they were hearing different things from both -- from those
23 two channels.	And that's confusi ng.
24 MS. SPEIER:	There's hardly any reference to Secretary
25 Perry, who has been included as one of the tres am i gos.	Did

276


you have any contact with him?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I didn't.
3 MS. SPEIER:	And he was never i n any of your text
4 messages?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, not in any text messages.	He
6 was in two phone calls, Ms. Speier.	Early on the -- I think
7 two phone calls.	Certainly was in the June 28th phone call,
8 and he might have been -- I'll check my notes to see if he
9 were in the June 18 phone call.	But those were the only two
IO	times that I heard him on the phone or had any interaction
II	with him.
12 MS. SPEIER:	Did you think it was peculiar that he was
13 engaged in this?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No.	Secretary Perry is very
15 interested in energy markets.	Ukraine could be a big energy
16 market .	It would be -- Secretary Perry knows that there are
17 a lot of companies. in particular in Texas, but I'm sure in
18 other places. who would like to sell liquid natural gas,
19 liquefied natural gas. LNG, to Ukraine or east Europe more
20 broadly.	So he had been interested in this, and I didn't
21 think this was very unusual.
22 MS. SPEIER:	So, on page 12, third paragraph, you
23 reference that President Trump did insist that President
24 Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening
25 investigations of Biden and the 2016 election interference.

277



Was that specific reference to Biden and not Burisma?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I would check my notes, but I think
3 the answer is yes.
4 MS. SPEIER:	So it was very specific to an investigation
5 of Biden?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
7 MS. SPEIER:	All right.	There was a lot of discussion
8 after September 11th that it might be difficult to get all
9 the money out to Ukraine -- by the September 30th end of the
10 fiscal year.	How much money actually got released?
11 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I should know the answer to that.	I
12 don't know the answer to that.	I know it's probably about
13 90 percent of -- that's rough. Ms. Speier. but roughly
14 90 percent.
15 MS. SPEIER:	Okay.	And my last question is, at one
16 point, there was a reference made, I think i t's on page 9,
17 where Mr. Morrison references that the President doesn't want
18 to provide any assistance at all.	And that's in quotes.
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.
20 MS. SPEIER:	Did that alarm you?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It did.
22 MS. SPEIER:	And coupled with that May 23rd, I think it
23 was, meeting in the White House where everyone came back very
24 excited and the President seemed very unexcited, what does
25 that tell you about his interest in Ukraine?

278


AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Again, I have never -- I wasn't in
2 that meeting.	I've never had conversations with the
3 President.	Secretary Pompeo did tell me the same thing that
4 the participants of that May 23rd meeting sai d, and that was
5 the Presi dent was skeptical of Ukraine.	And we've heard
6 several descriptions of the skepticism.	Some appear in this
7 -- the Politico article.	I mean, he was concerned about the
8 allegations here.	And that's as much as I know about the
9 President's vi ew.
10 MS. SPEIER:	Okay.	Thank you.
11 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you.
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	Representat i ve Lieu.
13 MR. LIEU:	All right.	Thank you. Ambassador Taylor, for
14 your service to our country.	Thank you for serving in
15 Vietnam with the 101st Air borne.	I note for the record you
16 jumped out of perfectly fine airplanes, so thank you for your
17 courage.
18 I'd like to talk about U.S. national security.	It's a
19 fundamental principle, in tent of U.S. national security to
20 push back against Russian aggression. correct?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: [Nonve rbal response.]
22 MR. LIEU:	And Ukraine is one of the countries at the
23 tip of the spear of pushing back against Russian aggression,
24 correct?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It is.




279


MR. LIEU:	And on page eight of your statement, you
2 write, Ambassador Volker and I could see the armed and
3 hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of a damaged
4 bridge across the line of contact.	Over 13,000 Ukrainians
5 had been killed in the war, one or two a week.	More
6 Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance.
7 But I want to make clear, U.S. security assistance to
8 Ukraine isn't just to help Ukrainian national security.	It's
9 also to help U.S. national security.	Is that right?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It is.	That's correct.
II	MR. LIEU:	All right.	And, in fact, that's why, as you
12 said, the Department of Defense within a day came back with
13 analysis saying:	We need to give security assistance to
14 Ukraine.
15 Isn't that right?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That is correct.
17 MR. LIEU:	Okay.	When the President of the United
18 States freezes aid to Ukraine, the Russians can detect
19 weakness, isn't that right, between the U.S. and Ukrainian
20 relationship?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The Russians are very careful
22 observers of Ukraine and the United States, and they would

23immediately -- my betis they knew.	They're very good.My24bet is they knew thatthere was something up with the25security assistance.So --
280


MR. LIEU:	And if the U.S. doesn't give security
2 assistance, it could in effect embolden the Russians to be
3 even more aggressive towards Ukraine.	Isn't that right?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Absolutely right.
5 MR. LIEU:	Okay.	So, when the President of the United
6 States freezes security aid to Ukraine for months and months
7 and months, that not only harms Ukrainian national security,
8 it also harms U.S. national security.	Isn't that right?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes, sir.
10 MR. LIEU:	All right.	Let me move on quickly to one
II	other aspect.	The public reporting on Ambassador Sondland's
12 testimony is that he didn't remember a lot of stuff.	You
13 have a number of conversations here with Ambassador Sondland.
14 I just want to make sure, in those conversations, there was
15 no indication he was under the influence of alcohol, correct?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
17 MR. LIEU:	He didn't slur his words, correct?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
19 MR. LIEU:	There was no indication that he was under any
20 medications that caused him short-term memory loss, correct?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not that I know of.
22 MR. LIEU:	Okay.	And last couple questions.	The State
23 Department told you not to come here today.	Is that fair?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	They did.
25 MR. LIEU:	So did they tell you to also not give




281



documents and notes to Congress, your notes?	Did they say
2 you can't provide that to
3 MR. BELLINGER:	They did.	We've been prohibited from
4 providing documents directly to Congress.
5 MR. LIEU:	Okay.	Thank you.	That's all I have.
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you.
7 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you, Mr. Lieu.
8 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
9 Q	Just a couple of sort of cleanup questions for you,
10 Ambassador Taylor, and then I think, at least, on the II	majority side, we'll be finished.
12 You were asked by Mr. Jordan about the number of
13 conversations that you had with Tim Morrison, the senior
14 director on the NSC.	Is it fairly common to speak regularly
15 with members of the NSC who cover the country where you are
16 the effective Ambassador or Charge de mission?
17 A	Mr. Goldman, you know, a lot of it depends on the
18 pace of activity in certain issues, and it certainly is the
19 case in this one.	So the role, of course, of the senior
20 director is to be the interface between the President,
21 National Security Advisor and the President, and the
22 i ntera gency.
23 And, often, they'll be in direct interactions with
24 people in the field.	In particular, I think it's the case
25 that embassies or ambassadors will be in touch.	I try to





282



keep my, you know, DAS Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary
2 George Kent, advised on all of these things, but it's also
3 very common for an NSC director or senior director to be
4 directly in touch.
5 And when I said it was dependent to some degree on the
6 issue, I think I mentioned that Tim Morrison, much more than
7 Fiona Hill, Dr. Hill, was very ihterested in Chinese
8 i nvestmen t in Ukraine, continues to today.	So our
9 conversations, the vast bulk of the conversations I had with
10 Ti m Morrison concerned the Chinese attempts to buy a

II	Ukrainian 
12 And he has been a

manufacturer  Tim Morrison has been a driving

13 force i n Washington to try to prevent that, and we are on the
14 front end of that.	And so, you know, I go down to -
15	, and I visit and talk to people who are looking
16 for alternative investors, and Ambassador Bolton, when he was
17 there, and Ti m was there for that visit.
18 The main focus of Ambassador Bolton's visit and
19 conver sati ons with all of these officials that he had in the
20 Ukrainian Government was China.	And, again, this was the day
21 before Ukrainians knew that there was even a hold.	But it
22 was China and its attempt to buy 
23	
24 So, when the question comes, how often are you talking
25 to -- well, it depends on the issue.	And if there's any --




283


so, for example, Fiona was focused on Russia.	She's a Russia
2 expert.	And the Russia-Ukraine Donbas negotiations were
3 stall ed.	So there was not much happening there.	What was
4 not stalled was the Chinese attempt -- well, what was not
5 stalled was our attempt to block Chinese purchase of these
. 6	       So that's what -- Ti m was
7 on the phone a lot for those purposes.
8 Q	You mentioned that you kept Deputy Assistant
9 Secretary Kent as much up to date as you could.
10 A	Yeah.
11 Q	Did you speak -- during the last few months, since
12 you arrived there in mid-June, did you speak at all with
13 Assistant Secretary Phil Reeker?
14 A	A couple of times.	Phil Reeker has not focused
15 very much on Ukraine.	He relies heavily on George Kent as
16 the DAS.	And George, as we know, is -- you have had him.
17 You know George, so he's great.	He's an incredible resource
18 on Ukraine and Thailand, by the way.
19 When I was there in 2006, 2009, he was the deputy
20 political counselor.	He then, of course, went back as the
21 DCM.	He then was pulled back to be the DAS, De puty Assistant
22 Secretary.	He is a wealth of	as you probably heard from
23 him, he's a wealth of knowledge.	So Phil Reeker relies on
24 George Kent, and I'm in constant contact with George Kent.
25 We have weekly -- we have regular weekly SVTC meet i ngs.

284



QDid you ever raise any concerns about the -- what2you callthe irregular policy path or track with Ambassador3Reeker?4AI don't think so.	I think it was primarily with
5 George Kent.
6 Q	Any other conversations on the sub topics today
7 with Ambassador Reeker that come to mind?
8 A	No.	So, let's see, Ambassador Reek er, I thi nk, was
9 in my	I have to check my notes on this too -- I thi nk was
10 in my meeting with Secretary Pompeo, I'm pretty sure he was,
11 on the 28th of May, before I decided -- as I was deci di ng.
12 And Phil was there.	And Phil Reeker travels a lot.	He has
13 got all the European countries, and so he's on the road more
14 than average, I will say, and so hasn't focused a whole lot
15 on Ukraine.
16 Q	You said you received reaction to your cable on
17	August 29th from the sixth floor.	Who responded to you?
18 A	It was actually George Kent, who may actually be on
19 the fifth floor, but, you know, down one.
20 Q	Okay.	What about Under Secretary David Hale?	Did
21 you communicate at all with him?
22 A	On occasion.	I went to see him before I went out.
23 And he had visited Kyiv before I got there. so I was hoping
24 to have him come out, but he didn't.	But only on occasion
25 would I -- I may have tried to be sure that he got the cable,




285


the not i ce cable.
2 Q	Okay.	But you never spoke to hi m about it?
3 A	No.
4 Q	Did you ever speak to anybody other than George
5 Kent about your -- at the State Departm ent about your not i ce
6 cable?
7 A	Ulrich Brechbuhl, I believe, the counselor, just to
8 be sure that he got i t because I wanted to be sure that the
9 Secretary got it.
10 Q	Ri ght.	But you never received a response --
11 A	I di dn't.
12 Q	-- in any meaningful way?
13 A	I didn't.
14 Q	Did you ever recei ve any indication when you
15 relayed any concerns to the State Department about this
16 irr egular policy group that anyone in the Department actually
17 took any steps to resolve anything?
18 A	There was some discomfort within the State
19 Department with Ambassado r Sondland's role in Ukraine.	Of
20 course, Ukrain e is not in the EU.	But it was well-known
21 that, in that famous May 23rd meeting in the Oval Offi ce,
22 that Ambassador Sandland was given direction, with Secretary
23 Perry and Ambassador Volker, to focus on Ukraine, to do
24 something with regard to Ukra i ne policy.
25 Q	You testified a little bit earlier about a staffdel





286


or Atlantic Council trip --
2 A	Yep.
3 Q	where you met with a staff member from the
4 Intelligence Committee, right?	And you had no conversations
5 about any of these issues --
6 A	No.
7 Q	-- with tha t individual?
8 A	No.
9 Q	Were you aware that there were also three staff
10 members from -- Republican Members of Congress who were on
II	the Foreign Affairs Committee on that trip as well?
12 A	I knew the names and affiliations and members or
13 committees that each of those members of the staffdel were
14 on.
15 Q	Did you have any conversations with any of those
16 staff membe rs about any of the issues here today?
17 A	No.	This was a briefing, as I say, in my
18 resi dence.	I gave them a briefing, and then we had an
19 opportunity for questions and answers, and they hit it off.
20 Q	Are you familiar with the individuals Lev Parnas
21 and Igor Fruman?
22 A	I only know them through the newspaper s.
23 Q	Or the indictments?
24 A	Or the indictments in the newspap ers.
25 Q	So you were not - - but prior to the public reports

287



about thei r involvement in Ukraine and their association with
2 Rudy Gi uli ani, you were not aware of them i n any way?
3 A	Mr. Goldman, looking back on this, I thi nk back in
4 like March or Apri l someone had -- again, when I was at the
5 Inst i tute of Peace -- sent me some descrip ti on of
6 interference in - - what was this deal -- in maybe a natural
7 gas -- I thi nk there was a - - I think there was a proposal to
8 sell natura l gas to Ukraine.
9 And I think the person who was tell i ng me this
10 referenced these two names, which I didn't recognize at the
II	time, and I didn't even register at the time.	But now, you
12 know, in the last, you know, now they're indicted or now they
13 were picked up at -- then I now recollect that they were
14 mentioned in this previous discussion.

15 Q

16 A

Who were you having this conversation with?
I got a note from a man named Dale Perry.	He's a

17 businessman.
18 Q	Did you get an open letter from Dale Perry?	Did
19 you ever see tha t, or a memo of some sort?
20 A	Yes.	Yes.	Which I then sent -- again, it meant
21 nothing to me.	I was at the Institute of Peace.	I had no
22 idea what he was talking about, but I sent it to George Kent
23 and to Masha Yovanovitch.
24 Q	Okay.	Did you ever get a readout of the priv ate
25 meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky at

288



UNGA in New York after their press conference?
2 A	Ambassador Volker gave me a description, I think,
3 of that meeting.	It was not too private.	I mean, there were
4 staffs on both si des, right.	Okay.	I think there's only
5 one.	So I think -- and Ambassador Volker, with not in great
6 detai l, he was in the meeting and said that it was a good
7 meeting.
8 The President left pleased that they had finally met
9 face to face.	They discussed some connections between
IO	President Zelensky's cabinet or his government and several
II cabinet members on President Trump's team that they should
12 connect.
13 Q	Was there any discussion that you heard of, whether
14 it was at the principal level or the staff level, about any
15 of these investigations that we've been talking about?
16 A	No.
17 Q	Now, you said that the new prosecutor general --
18 A	Yes.
19 Q	-- confirmed that he is looking into the issues
20 that were the subject of the
21 A	"Confirm ed" may be too strong.
22 Q	Sorry.	Just for the record --
23 A	Right.	Right.	Right.	So what he said, I think
24 fairly recently, last couple of weeks, was that he was going
25 to take a look at all of the cases that had been closed over

289


the past several years to be sure they were done correctly.
2 Q	And would that include a Burisma investigation?
3 A	Could.
4 Q	Or the 2016 election interference --
5 A	Could.
6 Q	-- investigation?
7 A	Could.
8 Q	So would you say that, at the end of the day, that
9 President Trump got the investigations that he was pressuring
10 Ukraine for?
11 A	Hasn't gotten them yet, and, of course, President
12 Zelensky d i dn' t have to go in front of a mike and say this.
13 But Mr. -- but the prosecutor general did say that he was
14 going to take a look at any or all of these cases that may
15 have been closed for no good reasons.
16 Q	All right.	So he's at least open to looking into

17 this?
18 A

19 Q



He's at least open, yes.
Okay.	I think -- all right.	We are out of time

20 anyway.	So we'll yield to the minority.
21 MR. JORDAN:	Thank you, Ambassador.
22 I want to go back to the phone calls you had with
23 Mr. Morrison.	In the last hour, when I asked you, you said
24 that there were several -- just a few minutes ago when
25 majority counsel asked you, you said that many of those calls





290


dealt with the issue of China and its influence or attempt to
2 i nfluence Ukrainian -- the country of Ukraine.
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
4 MR. JORDAN:	That's all fair?
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
6 MR. J ORDAN:	But there were at least four calls where it
7 wasn't about China because you reference four calls in your
8 testimony?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Absolutely.
IO	MR. J ORDAN:	Were there other calls that weren't about
II	China that were about this subject that aren't ref lected in
12 your testimony?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I don't think so.	I
14 tried, as I went through my notes, to pull out everything
15 tha t I could on this topic.	I think I got them all, but I
16 I think I got them all.
17 MR. JORDAN:	So you think any conversation you had with
18 Mr. Morrison rela tiv e to the subject that we've been
19 discussing all day are at lea st highlighted and referenced in

20youropening statement?21AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, that was my intent --22MR. JORDAN:	That was your intent.23AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	-- and I hope I succeeded.	Others24havetaken a look through these, and I think I'm okay on25that.
291


MR. JORDAN:	And it's not out of the -- well , let me ask
2 it this way.	Let's go to the fir st -- the first call is a
3 couple days, 3 days after the call between President Trump
4 and Presi dent Zelensky, and you get a readout from
5 Mr. Morrison about Presi dent Trump and President Zelensky's
6 call.	Is that accurate?	It's on page nine of your testimony
7 at the top.
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Page nine, let's see.
9 MR. J ORDAN:	Top of page nine.
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	All right.	Yes.
II	MR. JORDAN:	That's your first readout of the call
12 between President Trump and President Zelensky?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
14 MR. J ORDAN:	Okay.	And why did Mr. Morrison call you?
15 Did he call you to give you a readout of tha t call, or was
16 there -- and/or some other reason?
17 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That wil1  be in my notes.	So what I
18 did, Congressman, in preparat i on for this, I tried to pull
19 out all relevant phone calls, meetings, et cetera, and within
20 each of those phone calls, I wrote down the components of
21 those or aspects of those that was relevant here, which means
22 that I didn't write down, and so I'm not remembering what
23 other topics.	I know that there were other topics in many of
24 these calls.
25 MR. J ORDAN:	Okay.	You don't know about this one?





292


AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't --
2 MR. JORDAN:	You know this was talked about, what you
3 referenced in your testimony, that he gave you a readout of
4 President Trump, President Zelensky's call.
5 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I do.
6 MR. JORDAN:	And there may have been something else on
7 the call.	You don't recall?
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	There could have been other things
9 on the call as well, yes.
10 MR. JORDAN:	Who initiated this call?
II	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	You asked me this before, and I
12 probably told you that I couldn' t remember.	It's not clear
13 to me from my notes here whether or not I did it or he did
14 it.	Again, I
15 MR. JORDAN:	Can you hazard a guess who likely initiated
16 the call?	Was it you calling him , or did he call you to talk
17 about this?	And was this his primary focus of the call,
18 giving you a readout of President Trump, President Zelensky's
19 call?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I can't hazard a guess.
21 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Probably other issues on the call.
23 Again, his main focus was not this; it was China.
24 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	But I don't want to guess.

293



MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	Let's go to the next page.
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
3 MR. JORDAN:	Your second call with Mr. Morrison, it
4 looks like the big paragraph about halfway down, on
5	September 1st.
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yep.
7 MR. JORDAN:	And can you give me the particulars of this
8 call?	Did he call you?	Did you call him?	Was it a
9 scheduled call?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Ah, so this was -- so he was in
II	Warsaw on September 1st, yeah.
12 MR. JORDAN:	You indicate at the bottom of the paragraph
13 that he gives you a readout of the call that took place
14 between President Zelensky and Vice President Pence.	Is that
15 accurate?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	Yes.	Yes.
17 MR. JORDAN:	All right .	And, again, how did this call
18 come about?
19 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Same way the others did, which is
20 one of the two of us emails on an unclass system the interest
21 in having a phone call.	The other writes back and says:	The
22 time is good.	Let's go it at such and such a time.
23 I go to a secure phone and get on it.	So I can't hazard
24 a guess on who initiated this one either, Congressman.
25 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	And was it the primary focus to give

294


you a readout of the call between the President of Ukraine
2 and the Vice President of the United States?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
4 MR. J ORDAN:	Okay.	So now we have two call s that you
5 get from Mr. Morrison, you i ni ti ate, he i ni ti ates.	It's on
6 the thing.	Some of them are on the weekend.	And both are
7 readouts from Mr. Morrison giving you a readout between
8 either the Presi dent's call with the President of Ukraine or
9 the Vice President's call with the President of Ukraine?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
11 MR. J ORDAN:	Ri ght.	And then we have the third one,
12 tha t we discussed earlier, whi ch I think took place on the
13 7th.	Is that right?	Page twelve of your testi mony.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Conversation with Mr. Morrison in
15 which he describes -- yes.
16 MR. JORDAN:	So now we have Mr. Morrison and you getting
17 on the phone again, and Mr. Morrison is giving you a readout
18 of a conversation that Ambassador Sondland had with President
19 Trump?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Correct.
21 MR. J ORDAN: And is this - - I guess, maybe it is.	I
22 don't know.	Is it customary for the NSC to call up the
23 Ambassador and give them readouts of the Presi dent and Vice
24 Presi den t's phone calls?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	It's not unusual for the NSC to be

295


describing the policy steps that need to be implemented
2 coming out of phone calls.	That's not unusual.
3 MR. JORDAN:	That's not what I asked.	I asked
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Sorry.
5 MR. JORDAN:	-- is it unusual for the new guy at the NSC
6 to call you three times in 5 weeks and give you a readout of
7 the Vice President's call with President Zelensky, the
8 President's call with President Zelensky, and the President's
9 call with Ambassador Sandland?	I'm asking, is that unusual?
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, I'm trying to be
II	responsive here.	It doesn't seem unusual to me.
12 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	Yeah.	I mean, I read this, and i t's
13 like Mr. Morrison, new on the job, and he calls you four
14 times relative to the subject matter that this committee is
15 looking into.
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.
17 MR. JORDAN:	And three of those four times is to give
18 you a direct readout of the Vice President's conversation
19 with someone else or the President, on two occasions the
20 President of the United States talking with someone else.
21 And you' re saying that happens all the time?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Those meetings don' t happen all the
23 time, as we know.	So it doesn't happen all the time.
24 MR. JORDAN:	Is it customary for the person at the NSC
25 to, when the President of the United States has a





296



conversation with someone and the Vice President of the
2 United States has a conversation with someone, is it
3 customary for someone at the NSC to call up the Ambassador
4 and say, "Hey, I just want to let you know what the President
5 said on his call"?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Congressman, my understanding is not
7 unusual.
8 MR. JORDAN:	Not unusual?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Not unusual.
10 MR. JORDAN:	And the fact that you had three of those in
II	this sort of time period, that's not unusual?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The unusual aspect of that is that
13 there were meetings of the President of the United States
14 with someone having to do with Ukraine in that short period
15 of time.
16 MR. JORDAN:	Okay.	All right.
17 MR. ZELDIN:	And, by the way, Ambassador, just to follow
18 up with one quick question on that, when did you first meet
19 Mr. Morrison?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	In person, I met him when he came
21 with Ambassador Bolton to Ukraine the end of August.	That's
22 when I first met him in person.
23 MR. ZELDIN:	And so these phone calls from Tim Morrison
24 to you, you hadn't even met Tim Morrison before?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.

297



MR. ZELDIN:	An Ambassador can be recalled by the
2 President at any time with or without cause, correct?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm sure that's -- yes.
4 MR. ZELDIN:	A lot of claims in your opening statement
5 are without firsthand knowledge, and I just -- I wanted to
6 ask about one of them.	So, in your opening statement, you
7 reference Burisma five times.	You reference Biden twice.
8 One of those references of Biden was just a reference to the
9	July 25th call.	The other reference was on page 12 of
10	paragraph 3.	And so, on September 7th, Ambassador Sondland
II	has a call with the President, according to a conversation
12 that you had with Tim Morrison, right?
13 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	September 7th.	Are we looking at
14 the same paragraph?
15 MR. ZELDIN:	Third paragraph down on page 12.
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Right, in which he described a phone
17 conversation with Sandland and President Trump, yes, sir.
18 MR. ZELDIN:	This is the only reference in your opening
19 statement to Biden other than your one reference to the
20	July 25th call.	And this isn't firsthand.	It's not
21 secondhand.	It's not thirdhand.	But if I understand this
22 correctly, you're telling us that Tim Morrison told you that
23 Ambassador Sondland told him that the President told
24 Ambassador Sandland that Zelensky would have to open an
25 i nvesti gati on into Biden?

298


AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
2 MR. ZELDIN:	Is it possible that somewhere in that chain
3 of events that the President spoke to President Zelensky
4 about Burisma?	Probably assume President Trump spoke to
5 Ambassador Sandland about Burisma?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know, Congressman.
7 MR. ZELDIN:	Yeah.	It's just -- it's hard when we -- I
8 mean, it's one thing if you have firsthand information, but a
9 lot of what you're saying in your opening statement is not
10 firsthand information.	That's one example.	And it happens
II	to be the only reference at all in your opening statement to
12 Joe Biden.
13 You testified that the goal requesting investigations
14 into the 2016 election in Burisma was to influence the U.S.
15 election.	Is that correct?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm sorry.	Say that again,
17 Congressman.
18 MR. ZELDIN:	I believe you testified earlier that the
19 goal of requesting investigations into the 2016 election and
20 Burisma was to influence the U.S. election.	Is that an
21 accurate reflection of your testimony from earlier?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't think so.
23 MR. ZELDIN:	Would you like to tell us what your
24 position is on it?	What was the goal of requesting
25 investigations into 2016 election and Burisma?

299



AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	As I understand it from one of
2 the -- maybe the article in The New York Times about
3 Mr. Giuliani's interest i n Burisma, in that article, he
4 desc r i bes, and I think he quotes Giuliani at some leng th,
5 that article indicates that Giuliani was interested in
6 getting some information on Vice President Biden that would
7 be useful to Mr. Giuliani's cli ent.	I think that's what he
8 says.	He says he's got one client, and he's useful to the
9 client.
10 MR. ZELDIN:	And then it's your inference that
II	Mr. Giuliani's goal would be the President's goal?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yes.
13 MR. ZELDIN:	And your source is The New York Times?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
15 MR. ZELDIN:	So do you have any other source that the
16 .Presi dent's goal in making this request was anything other
17 than The New York Ti mes?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I have not talked to the Presi den t.
19 I have no other information from what the President was
20 thi nki ng.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	Is it possible that requesting an
22 investigation, for example, into the 2016 election wasn't to
23 influence a future election?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm sorry.	Can you say tha t one
25 again?

300



MR. ZELDIN:	Is it possi ble that the request to
2 investigate interference with the 2016 election was not to
3 influence a future election?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know, Congressman.
5 MR. ZELDIN:	Well, you just told us what you inferred
6 based off of what The New York Times told you Rudy Giuliani
7 was thinking, which i nferr ed what the President was thinking.
8 I'm asking you to answer a question that, is it possible that
9 the request to investigate the 2016 election was for a reason
10 other than i nfluenc i ng the 2020 election?	Is that possible?
II	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know if it's possible.
12 MR . ZELDIN:	I remember you testified a little earlier
13 that you' re familiar wi th the Robert Mueller i nvesti gati on.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I said I'd heard of the Robert
15 Mueller investigation, yes, sir.
16 MR. ZELDIN:	And the investigation was still ongoi ng at
17 that time, correct?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I suppose -- yes.
19 MR. ZELDIN:	Was your understanding of the Robert
20 Mueller investigation that Robert Mueller was i nvest i gati ng
21 foreign interference in the U.S. election
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
23 MR. ZELDIN:	-- from 2016?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
25 MR. ZELDIN:	As far as Burisma and Zlochevsky, when did




30 1


you fi rst become familiar with this corrupti on case?
2 AMB ASSADOR TAYLOR:	With Burisma, I thi nk this summer
3 when it became -- when it was an item in the press.

[6:30 p.m.]
2 MR. ZELDIN:	And can you give us a rough idea of when
3 that might have been?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I can't.
5 MR. ZELDIN:	A month?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	July.
7 MR. ZELDIN:	And you wrote in your opening -- you
8 testi fi ed in your opening statement, i t's on page 6,
9 paragraph 2, quote:	By mid-July it was becoming clear to me
10 that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on
II	the in vest i gat i ons of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian
12 interference in the 2016 elections.
13 So that was mid-July.	Is it	had you back fam i li ar
14 with this case before mid-July?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	As I say, I don't remember exactly
16 when I became familiar with that case.
17 MR. ZELDIN:	I'm having trouble understanding how you
18 would have concluded it was clear to you by mid-July that the
19 meeting President Zelensky wanted conditioned on the
20 investigations of Burisma if you can' t even testify now that
21 you had even heard of the Burisma case by then.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I think I said it was sometime this
23 summer.	And I don't know exactly when it was.
24 MR. ZELDIN:	So it's possible that you did hea r Burisma
25 before mid-July?




303



AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
2 MR. ZELDIN:	And then in mid-Ju ly it, as you testified,
3 became clear to you that the meeting tha t President Zelensky
4 wanted was condi ti oned on an i nvesti gati on into Burisma and
5 alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. electi ons.
6 Obviously you would be i den ti fyi ng at that point that i t's
7 important to the President, that investigation, if you were
8 reaching that conclusion?
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: No.	What I know is what - - what
10 Ambassador Sondland was able to tell me about those
II	investigations and Ambassador Volker.	I don' t know what was
12 in the President's mind.
13 MR. ZELDIN:	So where was this condition coming from if
14 you're not sure if it was coming from the President?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I think it was coming from Mr.
16 Gi uli ani.
17 MR. ZELDIN:	But not from the President?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know.
19 MR. ZELDIN:	And you testified earlier that Mr. -- you
20 were interpreting Rudy Gi uli ani' s advocacy as the position of
21 the Presi dent ?
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	What I said -- what I said, I think,
23 was the President was Gi uli ani' s cli ent.
24 MR. ZELDIN:	And by Rudy Giu li ani -- you believe in
25 mi d-J uly, when you reached this conclusion, that Rudy





304



Giuliani wants an investigation into Burisma.	Are you
2 believing at all that the President wants an investigation
3 into Burisma or no?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know.	What I know is that
5 the direction was coming from Giuliani.
6 MR. ZELDIN:	Okay.	Well, it's important to point out
7 then, because your opening statement has leaked because
8 that's what's been happening during these depositions, so
9 everyone outside has read your opening statement, but what
10 they haven't read obviously is that you're testifying now
II	that you're not even sure if that condition came from the
12 President.	You don' t even know where it came from.	You're
13 guessing maybe Rudy Giuliani and you're not sure whether or
14 not it came from the President.	Is that what you're saying?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	What I'm saying is that I' m
16 describing conversations that I heard.	I didn't hear it from
17 the President.	I can't say what the President was thinking.
18 I can -- I can say what Kurt Volker and Ambassador Sandland
19 told me.
20 MR. ZELDIN:	Did you have any firsthand knowledge that
21 confirms that the President was conditioning an investigation
22 into Burisma and alleged election -- Ukrainian interference
23 in the 2016 elections with a meeting with President Zelensky?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Again, I had no conversations with
25 the President.

305



MR. ZELDIN:	So did you have any firsthand knowledge at
2 all to support tha t?
3 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Firsthand meaning -- firsthand
4 meaning had I talked to the President?	No, I've never talked
5 to the President.
6 MR. ZELDIN:	Or any other firsthand knowledge, other
7 than a communication directly with the President.
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No communication with the President.
9 MR. ZELDIN:	And no communication with Rudy Giuliani.
10 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	There was none with Giuliani, only
II	with Sondland and Volker.
12 MR. ZELDIN:	Why wouldn't you want to get more familiar
13 with the case on its merits at this time?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm sorry, Congressman, say it
15 again.
16 MR. ZELDIN:	Why wouldn't you want to get more fami li ar
17 with the case on its merits at that time?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I am trying to do U.S. foreign
19 policy.	I am trying to stay out of U.S. domestic policy and
20 politics.	So I'm not looking to get involved in that.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	Did the merits of the case matter to you
22 did the merits of the case matter to you in tak i ng that
23 position?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: The merits of the case ma tter by
25 taking the position of staying out of domestic politics.

306


MR. ZELDIN:	But the merits of whether or not there was
2 actual corruption was not part of your decisionmaking process
3 at that time?
4 As part of your decision -- in mid- Ju ly you make this
5 conclusion of a condition.	And I'm just asking if part of
6 that decisionmaking process of what to do next included any
7 analysis of thi s particular corruption case on its merits.
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I did not inv esti gate the Burisma
9 case on its merits.
10 MR. ZELDIN:	Were there any meetings at that time at the
11 embassy to discuss the case on its merits?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	What we did at the embassy, as I
13 mentioned, is we are focused on institutions, not on specific
14 cases.	We're looking to fight back against corruption and to
15 help the Ukrainians fight back against corruption by
16 improving their courts and their judicial system.	That's
17 not on individual cases.
18 MR. ZELDIN:	And if you did take the time to analyze the
19 case on its merits and you were to determine that i t, in
20 fact, had merit, that thi s was a corruption case impacting
21 parties from both the Ukraine and the United States, wouldn't
22 you possibly conclude differently with regard to an answer
23 you gave earlier where you said this was not in the U.S.
24 interest?
25 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Can't answer that one.	Don't know.

307




2
inMR. ZELDIN:	If the case had merits, maybe it would be
the U.S. interest.3AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Don't know, Congressman.4MR. ZELDIN:	And I believe you might have testified
5 earlier, U.S. law conditions aid to Ukraine based off of
6 their efforts to make progress in fighting corruption,
7 correct?
8 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Some of the security assistance has
9 conditions in the Defense Authorization Act every year that
10 has conditions on their -- having to do with civilian control II	of the military and those kinds of thi ngs.	And it may well
12 have some language about governance in contracting.
13 MR. ZELDIN:	If the President believed that looking
14 further into Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and
15 Burisma had merit where would he have gone if you aren't
16 going to even look into it?	What other way does he have to
17 look into these two cases?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	He has -- he has a lot of resources,
19 Congressman, as you know.	In the Justice Department I think
20 he's suggested or directed further i nvest i gati ons of 2016 and
21 related things.	So he's got many ways to i nvesti gate.
22 MR. ZELDIN:	But you weren't one of those resources?
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's correct.
24 MR. ZELDIN:	So before you send your text on September
25 1st, it appears that there were two things that you come in

308


contact with, one being the Politico story that we spoke
2 about earlier and on page 10 a September 1st conversation
3 between Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak in Warsaw.
4 With regards to that September 1st reference in your
5 opening statement, the source of your information is Ti m
6 Morrison, correct?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I'm looking for your cite here.
8 MR. ZELDIN:	The bottom of page 10.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	The bottom of page 10, ri ght.
10 During the same phone call I had with Mr. Morrison, he
11 went on to describe a conversation Ambassador Sondland with
12 Yermak.
13 Yes, it was with Morrison.
14 MR. ZELDIN:	Tim Morrison.	Is he your only source of
15 i nformat i on?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
17 MR. ZELDIN:	Was he in that meeting?	Was he part of
18 that conversation with -- between Ambassador Sondland and
19 Mr. Yermak ?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I don't know.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	Well, how would Mr. Morrison know that
22 i nfo rma ti on if he wasn't in the meeting?
23 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Because he could have talked to
24 Ambassador Sondland.	I don't know which of those two.
25 MR. ZELDIN:	Okay.	So that conclusion, again, i t's not

309



firsthand or secondhand?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: It could have been firsthand.	I
3 don't know.	First or second --
4 MR. ZELDIN:	But i t's not your fi rsthand .	So best case
5 scenario it's your secondhand information, but maybe it's
6 thirdhand information.
7 On your call with Tim Morrison after the July 25th call
8 between President Trump and President Zelensky, did he tell
9 you anything in his readout other than the reference to
10 anything else specifically from the call other than the
II	reference to fire Lutsenko?
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.	He mentioned -- I think it was
13 he who mentioned -- that there had been discussion of the
14 previous ambassador.
15 Did I mention that?	I think I did.	Let's see here.
16 Yes, here we are.	Yes, he said, fire Lutsenko.	Talked
17 about the previous ambassador.	He mentioned Giuliani.	And
18 he mentioned -- and he mentioned that Gordon had -- Gordon
19 Sondland had called the President before and after the
20 meeting -- the phone call.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	But as far as what was on the July 25th
22 phone call, other than a reference to fire Lutsenko, what
23 else was specifically said on the call?
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Again, I just said that he also
25 talked about the previous ambassador, Ambassador Yovanovitch.

310



He mentioned Gi uli ani .	And that's all I have written down.
2 MR. ZELDIN:	After the text on September 1st, you then
3 had a conversation with Ambassador Sondland, correct?
4 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	September 1st, you're going to go
5 back to that one.
6 MR. ZELDIN:	Yes, we're going back to that.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Hang on here.	So -- this is when --
8 are you looking at page 13, Congressman?
9 MR. ZELDIN:	Well, you do talk about it on page 10.	At
10 the bottom is the reference to Ambassador Sondland's meeting
II	with Yermak that you heard from Tim Morrison.	And then it
12 goes through, as you go into the next page, the following
13 paragraphs are leading you into your conversation that you
14 had with Ambassador Sondland.	The first full paragraph on
15 page 11 is your text, and then you get into specifics about
16 the phone call in the following paragraph.
17 In that conversation between you and Ambassador
18 Sondland, did you ask him about the meeting he had with
19 Mr. Yermak that Tim Morrison told you about?
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I did not.
21 MR. ZELDIN:	So the basis of your i nformat i on,
22 secondhand or thirdhand, that there was a li nk between money
23 and an i nvest i gati on into Burisma, you then have an
24 opportunity to talk to the person who was in the meeting and
25 you don't even ask him whether or not that meeting happened

311



or i f thi s was discussed?
2 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I was -- there's no doubt that the
3 meeting happened.	And I di dn't ask him further about the
4 conversation with Yermak.
5 And those are -- you know, all I'm reporting -- all I' m
6 reporting is firsthand knowledge of my phone call with people
7 or my texts with people.
8 MR . ZELDIN :	Ri ght.
9 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: But you're right, those are often
10 about other conversati ons.
II	MR . ZELDIN:	But it seemed like that would have been a
12 good opportun i ty to ask Ambassador Sondland about the meeting
13 wi th Mr. Yermak, co rrect?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	And I di dn 't take the opportunity.
15 MR. ZELDIN:	How long was that phone call, if you
16 remember, between you and Ambassador Sondland on September
17 1st?
18 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: I don' t remember.
19 MR. ZELDIN:	Maybe	any i dea? Like a couple minutes
20 or 30 minutes?	Was it a short call, a long call?
21 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Let 's see here.	So we're talki ng
22 about the phone call on 11, on page 11. Is that right?
23 MR. ZELDIN:	On page 11.
24 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Yeah, yeah.	Right.	Asked me to
25 call him, which I did.	During that phone call, right.

312



Sondland told me he now recognized he made a mistake.
2 So probably, I don't know, 15 minutes. 20 minutes.
3 MR. ZELDIN:	And here you have a -- so the reference on
4 the phone call is to Burisma, not the Bidens. is that --is
5 that correct?	That's what's -- that's what's in your opening
6 statement?
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	During the phone call Ambassador
8 Sondland told me that President Trump told him he wants
9 President Zelensky to state publicly investigate Burisma and
IO	alleged --- is it that the one you're talking about?
II	MR. ZELDIN:	Yeah.
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	On the second paragraph?
13 MR. ZELDIN:	Yes.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yes.
15 MR. ZELDIN:	And nothing linking that to aid, correct?
16 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, the next paragraph describes how
17 it's linked to aid.

18 MR. ZELDIN:	Where
19 did Ambassador Sondland

where did -- where did -- where

20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR: Link it to aid?	So -
21 MR. ZELDIN:	Go ahead.
22 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Yeah.	So Ambassador Sondland on
23 this phone call tells me that he now recognizes that he'd
24 made a mistake when he told the Ukrainians that the only
25 thing they had to do in order to -- the only thing they had

313



to do -- only thing they would get if they -- if they
2 announced these investigations was a meeting.	Said that was
3 a mistake.
4 MR. ZELDIN:	That was never actually communicated to
5 Ukraine; correct?
6 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	No, I think that is what he
7 communicated to Yermak.
8 MR. ZELDIN:	According to a conversation that you had
9 with Tim Morrison about what Ambassador Sondland spoke to
10 Mr. Yermak?
II	AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	That's on the previous page, that's
12 correct.
13 MR. ZELDIN:	You had this conversation with Ambassador
14 Sondland and you didn't ask him?
15 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Did you just ask that?	Is that the
16 same question?	I just want to be sure I'm getting this.
17 Yeah, I did not ask him.
18 MR. ZELDIN:	Go ahead.
19 VOICE:	No, I'm just confused as to which call.
20
21
22
23

24

25





314


[6:46 p.m.]
2 MR. ZELDIN:	We are talking about the September 1st
3 phone call.	I believe the Ambassador is testi fyi ng that
4 Ambassador Sandland had communicated this to Mr. Yermak.	But
5 that i nfo r mati on is not from Ambassador Sandland; that
6 i nformat i on is from Tim Morrison, who may or may not have
7 been in that meeti ng with Ambassador Sandland and Mr. Yermak.
8 And then when Ambassador Taylor then sent this text and
9 had a call, during the call with Ambassador Sandland, he
10 didn't even ra i se that meeting at all wi th Mr. Yermak.
11 I just want to understand
12 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Got it.	Got it.	Right.
13 MR. ZELDIN:	-- that chai n.	Is that all corr ect?
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	I di dn't raise the Yermak meeting.
15 What I raised was the concern about linking the secur i ty
16 assistance to the investigation.	That was the concern.
17 MR. ZELDIN:	Right, but you didn't confirm,	though, that
18 that was actually communicated.	You d i dn' t ask Ambassador
19 Sandland that.
20 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	If he'd communicated it to the
21 Ukrainians?	No, I asked him about the linkage.
22 MR. ZELDI N:	R i g ht.
23 Okay, Steve.
24 BY MR. CASTOR:
25 Q	Looki ng back on these events, would you have

3 15



handled anything differently in terms of your communications
2 with the seventh floor of the State Department?
3 You sent your cable.	You know, you had a couple phone
4 calls with Mr. Brechbuhl.	But it doesn't seem like your
5 concerns penetrated.
6 A	Mr. Castor, I don' t think that 's true.	I think
7 that, first of all, they shared my concerns.	Second of all,
8 they got my cable.	Third of all, based on the concerns and
9 the cable, Secretary Pompeo went to the White House, probably
10 on a couple of occasions, you know, in trying to have these
II	meetings, and attempted to get the deci si on changed.	So I'm
12 comfortable --
13 Q	Okay.
14 A	-- that I got a response.
15 Q	Okay.	So, looking back on things, you wouldn't
16 have handled anything different?
17 A	Correct.
18 Q	Okay.
19 MR. CASTOR:	I'd just note for the record we haven ' t
20 seen a copy of the subpoena and we hav en' t made it a part of
21 the record.	Is that still on the table as an option?
22 MR. GOLDMAN:	We're hap py to show you a copy of the
23 subpoena.
24 MR. BITAR:	We're more than happy for you, Mr. Castor,
25 to also make sure tha t the seal i s authentic and that the

316


signature is authentic.	No worries.	I'll get it for you
2 now.
3 MR. GOLDMAN:	And apparently you have an email in your
4 inbox with the --
5 MR. CASTOR:	Oh, okay.	Yeah, I mean, I don't have my
6 email.
7 BY MR. CASTOR:
8 Q	You would agree that, if Burisma -- if their
9 motivation for engaging Hunter Biden for their board was not
10 rela ted to his corporate governance expertise but , in fact,
II	was hoping to buy some protection, you would agree that
12 that's worthy of investigating, right?
13 A	Mr. Castor, I don't know why Burisma got him on the
14 board.
15 Q	But if Ukrainians were engaged in misdeeds or
16 wrongdoing with regard to putting Hunter Biden on their
17 board, that could be something that could be worth
18 i nves ti gati ng, right?
19 A	I don't know.	I don't know.	I don't know the
20 rela ti onshi p that he had with the board.	I don't know.
21 Q	Okay.	And, at the ti me, the Vice Presi den t had a.
22 you know, policy supervision of Ukraine on some respects.
23 A	He was very interested in policy with Ukraine, yes.
24 Q	Okay.	So do you see a perceived conflict of
25 interest there?

3 1 7


A	I' m a fact witness.	I'm not gi vi ng opinions on --
2 Q	Okay.
3 A	this thing, but -- so I --
4 Q	Is it reasonable to see a perceived conflict of
5 interest there, or is that crazy?
6 A	I've said other things are crazy.
7 Q	A reasonable person could conclude that there is a
8 possible perceived conflict of interest there, right?
9 MR. BELLINGER:	You asked him that question earlier, at
10 the beginning, about 7-1/2 hours ago.	It was one of the
11 first questions you asked him.	He's already answered it.
12 MR. CASTOR:	So he's not going to answer it?
13 MR. BELLINGER:	He's already answered it.
14 BY MR. CASTOR:
15 Q	Have you had any communications with other
16 witnesses or likely witnesses before this investigation, such
17 as Mr. Morrison?	Presumably he's sort of on the docket next
18 to come in.	Have you had any conversations about your
19 testimony with other possible witnesses?
20 A	Not about testimony.	Again, he's very interested
21 in China, and we continue to talk about China --

22 Q
23 A

24 Q

25 A

Okay.
-- but nothing about With Mr. Reeker?
No.





3 18


Q	With some of the others?
2 A	No.
3 Q	You didn't have any communications with some of our

4 previous witnesses?
5 A	No.	Nothing on the substance of the testimony.
6 Q	And just one other item.	The State Department,
7 they didn't order you to not appear under subpoena, right?
8 A	Correct.
9 MR. CASTOR:	I think that's all I've got.	I'm out of
10 members, so -- I'm almost out of time. II		BY MR. GOLDMAN:
12 Q	Ambassador Taylor, you've been here a long time.	I
13 just wanted to address one thing --
14 A	Please.	Please.
15 Q	-- which was brought up in the last --
16 A	Yep.
17 Q	It will just be a couple minutes.	But we
18 understand you' re ti red and it's been a long day, and we --
19 A	No, no.	I am ti red, but it's okay.
20 Q	We appreciate it.	This won't be long.
21 A	Not a problem.
22 Q	So I think you testified earlier today that you
23 drafted your statement based on, in part, a review of your
24 notes and the various WhatsApp and text messages that you are
25 in possession of, right?

319


A	Correct.
2 Q	And so is it accurate that the statement, the
3 opening statement, that you gave is based on your very best
4 recollection after reviewing your own notes?
5 A	It is correct.
6 Q	Okay.	And so is that the most accurate recitation
7 of events that you can remember today?	Is --
8 A	It is.
9 Q	that right?

10 A

II	Q

It is.
When Mr. Zeldin was questioning you, he was talking

12 about the connection -- he was sort of conflating a couple
13 things between Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump, and the New York
14 Times article.	I just want to clarify a couple of things for
15 now.
16 You did see that May 9th New York Times article, which I
17 believe is exhibit 1, right?
18 A	I did.
19 Q	And so you understood from that article that
20 Mr. Giuliani was interested in pressing Ukraine to conduct
21 investigations into Biden and the 2016 election?
22 A	Correct.
23 Q	And that was before you took the job.

24 A
25 Q

It was. Okay.

320


A	It was one of the hesitations about taking the job.
2 Q	Right.	I believe you expressed in your text
3 messages your concerns about Rudy Giuliani and Biden in those
4 text messages.	Do you recall that?
5 A	I do.
6 Q	And were you aware of other public statements,
7 either on Twitter or on television, that Rudy Giuliani was
8 mak i ng frequently on this topic, about these investigations?
9 A	Not on Twitter or television, because I rarely do
10 either of those.	But in the general press, I think this is
I I	pretty well-described.
12 Q	Okay.
13 And then you also testified, right, that at that
14	May 23rd Oval Office meeting you understood that Presi dent
15 Trump directed Ambassadors Sandland, Volke r, and Secretary
16 Perry to consult with Rudy Giuliani in order for a White
17 House meeting to occur?
18 A	That was my understanding.
19 Q	That was your understanding.
20 A	Yes.
21 Q	And then after that point, you had many
22 conversations with Ambassadors Sandland and Volker about Rudy
23 Giuliani's interest in the investigations in Ukraine.	Is
24 that accurate?
25 A	Mr. Goldman, I don't remember many conversations

321


witn those two about Rudy Giuliani 's specific interest, but
2 certainly with the interest that they were expressing,
3 presumably coming from Giuliani, in having these
4 investigations proceed.
5 Q	Right.	And you say presumably coming from Rudy
6 Giuliani because you, A, understood that Rudy Giuliani was
7 interested in these investigations and, B, understood that
8 the President had directed them to discuss Rudy Giuliani's
9 concerns before scheduling a White House meeting.
10 A	A and B both correct.
11 Q	Okay.
12 And then you had a telephone call with Tim Morrison on
13	July 28th where he gave you a brief readout of the
14 President's call with President Zelensky.
15 A	Yes.
16 Q	And I believe you testified that you understood
17 also that Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump both
18 before and after that call?
19 A	Tim Morrison said that, that he had -- in that
20 call.	He said -- yes.
21 Q	Okay.	And then when you actually read the call
22 transcript, Tim Morrison's readout was accurate, correct?

23AItwas.24QItwasn't complete --25AItwasn't complete, but what he said was accurate.
322


Right.	Yes.
2 Q	And, subsequently then, you in early September had
3 two separate phone calls, right, with Ti m Morrison and
4 Ambassador Sandland about a phone call between Ambassador
5 Sandland and Presi dent Trump?
6 A	Correct.	And both -
7 Q	Right?
8 A	Yes.
9 Q	And both of those conversations, so what Ambassador
10 Sandland told you about his own conversation with President II	Trump and what Tim Morrison told you about Ambassador
12 Sondland's conversation with President Trump, were pretty
13 consistent.

14 A

15 Q

They were pretty consistent.
Right.	And you understood that President Trump was

16 i nsi sti ng and conditioning the White House meeting on, I
17 think, qu ote, "everything ," which was both the security
18 assistance and the White House meeting.
19 A	That's what Ambassador Sandland said.	He said that
20 they were li nked.	They were linked.
21 Q	Right.
22 A	I don't remember him saying President Trump said
23 that they had to be linked.
24 Q	Right.	But you understood Ambassador Sandland was
25 speaking regularly --




323


A	Having just gotten off the phone call with
2 President Trump, and he was then relaying it to Yermak
3 and me.
4 Q	Right.
5 And then you also had your own conversations with
6 Ukrainian officials about Rudy Giuliani, right?	And if I
7 could refresh you, because it's late, you, I think, testified
8 that on July 10th, when you had your meeting with the Chief
9 of Staff and the Defense Minister, they relayed to you that IO		they understood that Mr. Giuliani had said that there would II	not be a phone call.
12 A	Ah.	Yes.	Yeah, that's exactly right.	And that
13 came through the Prosecutor General Lutsenko.	Yes.
14 Q	Right.	And they certainly understood that
15 Mr. Giuliani represented President Trump, correct?


16 A

17 Q

They did.
Because why else would they care what Rudy Giuliani

18 thought?

19 A

20 Q

Correct.
And just to be clear, who ultimately decides

21 whether or not there is a White House meeting between the
22 President of the United States and any other foreign leader?
23 Is it Rudy Giuliani, or is it the President of the United
24 States?
25 A	It's the President of the United States.

324


Q	Okay.
2 MR. GOLDMAN:	Just 1 minute.
3 All right.	I think we are done.	I don't know if the
4 minority has a couple followup questions?
5 MR. CASTOR:	Thank you for coming in today.	We
6 appreciate your cooperation.
7 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Glad to be here.
8 THE CHAIRMAN:	I can tell my timing is good.
9 MR . GOLDMAN:	Chairman Schiff has arrived to adjourn the


10 proceedings.
11 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	No,


Unless he has questions.
no.	We are adjourned.	And I want to

13 thank you, Ambassador.
14 AMBASSADOR TAYLOR:	Thank you, Mr	Chairman.
