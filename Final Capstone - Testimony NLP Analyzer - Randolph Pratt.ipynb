    "I propose to make an NLP pipeline that will ultimately classify legal testimony into topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "Unreliable speech from public officials and news networks have reached a head in our nation.  News outlets, law offices, researchers, as well as others have an innate desire to be able to easily find relevant information within current, past, and future cases on the fly (immediate basis).  The purpose is to allow cross-referencing multiple testimonies and other public speech for inconsistencies and inaccuracies over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "Collect testimony, commentary, etc. from a target witness or person over years in the past to feed into our classifier.  The neural network will make determinations of the validity of statements in near real-time.  As one can imagine, having such a tool at your disposal during an interview can be powerful in challenging testimony.  This could broaden out to public statements made over news networks, social media, etc. to combat the misinformation propagated as of late.  Not only could AI be an effective tool in ensuring the accountability of truth to supersede all else but, we could create a subscription service to which news outlets and other researchers subscribe to have access to the neural network classifier utilizing datasets collected.  Future upgrade the subscription service could use the large datasets to run personality analyses on anyone with a public social account.  The benefit of this could target human resource prospecting applicants in hiring, negotiations between individuals/companies/foreign leaders, as well as other beneficial applications not listed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Sources and Access:\n",
    "https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record  - for publicly accessible transcripts of witness testimony.  It is easy to download documents and the entire site wouldn’t need to be scraped to analyze individuals for clients.\n",
    "Twitter – pulling in tweets for an individual over time can be done with a scraper in python.  \n",
    "Facebook – utilize Facebook’s api to get target information\n",
    "Instagram – utilize Instagram’s api to get target information\n",
    "With some expansion we could build a detailed profile of a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected techniques to be utilized:\n",
    "Scraping data from social media\n",
    "Joining/merging data\n",
    "Descriptive statistics on the imported data\n",
    "Cleaning the data \n",
    "NLP - parsing the text, removing Stopwords, tokenization, frequency of words, lemmatize the data, sentence analysis, bag of words (BoW), vectorize with tf-idf, word2vec, exploratory data analysis (EDA), principal component analysis (PCA), train/test , unsupervised learning algorithm, random forest classifier, logistic regression, KNN clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction for Largest Challenge to Project:\n",
    "Acquiring the variety of datasets and performing the various cleanings and tokenizations, will likely be lengthy.  As per the instructions for the project needing to be of a start-up company level, I don’t believe I can do less and still receive a positive grade.  Since I’m on a time crunch in trying to finish this project and present within a week, I am not sure this is possible.\n"

J ORDAN:\tThank you, Mr. Chairman.\tJust for the 17 7\trecord, on October 2nd, 2019, the Speaker of the House, Nancy 18 Pelosi, said that she would treat the President with 19 fairness.\tFa ir ness requires certain things.\tJust a few 20 minutes ago, the chairman of the Intel Committee said that 21 this is an official impeachment inquiry. 22 If it's an official impeachment inquiry, we should be 23 following precedent.\tEvery recent impeachment has permitted 24 minority subpoenas.\tThe right of the minority to issue 25 subpoenas subject to the same rules as the majority has been  6     the standard bipartisan practice in all recent resolutions 2 author i zi ng presidential impeachment inquiries.\tThat is not 3 the case today, has not been the case sin ce th i s, quote, 4 \"official impeachment i nqu i ry\" began. 5 Democ rat s' failure to provide ranking members with equal 6 subpoena power shows this is a partisan investigation. 7 Second, Democrats have threatened witnesses who request 8 agency counsel to be present for their tran scr i bed interview 9 and/or dep ositi on.\tState Department lawyers have a right to IO\tprotect executive branch interests, i nclud i ng national II security interests.\tDemocrats have threatened to withhold 12 salaries of State Department officials who ask for the 13 presence of State Department lawyers in depositions. 14 I've been in countless number of depositions and/ or 15 transcribed i nterv i ews, this is only the second one I've ever 16 seen where agency counsel was not perm i tted to be in the room 17 when a witness was deposed or asked questions, the first was 18 last Thursday.\tThe first witness as a part of this, qu ote , 19 \"off i c i al impeachment i nqu i ry.\" 20 And, finally, fa i rn ess r equi res due process.\tThe 21 President and minority should have the right to see all 22 evidence, both favorable and unfavorable.\tThe President and 23 mi nor i ty should have the ability to p resen t evi de nce bearing 24 on the cred i bi lit y of testifying witnesses.\tThe President 25 and the m i nor i ty should have the ab i l i ty to raise objections  7    relating to examination of witnesses, and the admissibility 2 of testimony and evidence.\tAnd the Pre si dent and the 3 minority should have the ability to respond to all evidence 4 and testimony presented. 5 With that, I would like to yield to my co ll eague from 6 the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Zeldin, for a f ew items to 7 put on the record as well. 8 MR. ZELDIN:\tYesterday, Ranking Member Mccaul sent a 9 letter to Chairman Engel consistent with what Mr. Jordan was 10 just referencing on the record, calling on the chair to honor I I\tthe bipartisan Rodino Hyde precedence that governed both the 12 Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquires, which guaranteed the 13 President's counsel the right to participate in these 14 proceedings, and allowed the minority to exercise coequal 15 subpoena author i ty. 16 Moving on.\tThe question is, what specific provision of 17 House rules gives the House Permanent Select Committee on 18 Intelligence the jurisdiction and authority to convene an 19 investigative inquiry of a State Department diplomat 20 regarding the conduct of U.S. fo r ei gn policy toward Ukraine? 21 That is clearly the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affa i rs 22 Committee, and to date, the House has not voted to give the 23 I n te l Committee any additional authority to conduct an 24 impeachment inquiry outside of its jur i sdi ct i onal la ne, which 25 concerns intelligence-related activities.    8     Can you please point us to anything in the House rules 2 that gives you this authority? 3 THE CHAIRMAN:\tWe're going to move forward with the 4 deposition rather than address the mischaracterizations of 5 both impeachment history and inquiries and process.\tI would 6 now recognize Mr. Goldman . 7 MR. MEADOWS:\tMr. Chairman, point of order.\tPoint of 8 order. 9 THE CHAIRMA N:\tMy colleague, we're not going to allow -­ 10 MR. MEADOWS:\tWell, you can't not allow -- I'm here to 11 tell you, Mr. Schiff -- 12 THE CHAIRMAN:\tWe're not going to allow any dilatory 13 MR. MEADOWS:\tyou know the House rules allows for 14 po· nt of order in any 15 THE CHAIRMAN:\tState your point of order. 16 MR. MEADOWS:\tThe point of order is the rules of the 17 House are very clear.\tThe gentleman raised a valid point 18 that there are no rules that would give the authority of you  19 to actually depose this witness.\tAnd so. under what 20 authority -- I would say you're out of order. 21 THE CHAIRMAN:\tI appreciate your opinion, but the House 22 deposition r ule s say otherwise.\tSo, Mr. Goldman, you are 23 recognized. 24 MR . z ELDIN:\tPoi nt of order , though , we a re aski ng what 25 that rule is that gives you the authority to conduct today 's  9    deposition. 2 MR. MEADOWS:\tRule 11 doesn' t outline anything. 3 THE CHAIRMAN:\tWe won' t allow any further dilatory 4 mot i on,s.\tM r. Gold man, you' re recogni zed. 5 MR. ZELDIN:\tWe're asking a simple que sti on. 6 MR. GOLDMAN:\tThi s i s the deposition of Ambassador Marie 7 Yovanovitch conducted by the House Permanent Select Committee &\ton Intellige nce , also called HPSCI, pursuant to the 9\timpeachment inquiry announced by the Speaker of t he House on 10\tSeptember 24th. II MR. GOLDMAN:\tAmbassador Yova nov i tch , cou ld you please 12 state you r full name and spell your last name for the record. 13 MR . ROBBINS:\tI'm sorry , before we begin the deposition. 14 Sor ry , I represent the witness.\tMy name is Larr y Robb i ns. 15 The ambassador has an opening state ment to make. 16 MR. GOLDMAN:\tWe'r e going to get to that. 17 MR. ROBBINS:\tI see. 18 MR . GOLDMAN:\tAft er we lay out the ground rul es here, 19 we'll turn it over to the Ambassador. 20 MR. ROBBINS:\tOkay.\tIt's a deal. 21 MR . GOLDMAN:\tAll right.\tIf you could go ahead and 22 please state your ful l nam e and spell it for the record. 23 MS. YOVANOVITCH:\tMar i e Louise Yovanovitch.\tMarie, 24 M-A-R-I-E, Louise, L-0-U-I-S-E, Yovanov i tch , 25\tY-0-V-A-N-O-V-I-T-C-H.  10     MR. GOLDMAN:\tThank you.\tAlong with other proceedings 2 in furtherance of the inquiry, the deposition is part of a 3 joint investigation led by the Permanent Select Committee on 4 Intelligence in coordination with the Committee on Foreign 5 Affairs. and the Committee on Oversight and Reform. 6 In the room today. I believe, are at least given the 7 option of having two majority staff and two minority staff 8 from both the Foreign Affairs and the Oversight Committees, 9 as well as majority and minority staff from HPSCI.\tThis is a 10 staff-led deposition, but members, of course, may ask II\tquestions during the allotted time. 12 My name is Daniel Goldman, I'm a senior advisor and 13 director of investigations for the HPSCI majority staff, and 14 I'd li ke to thank you for coming in today for this 15 deposition.\tI'd like to do some brief introductions.\tTo my 16 right is Nicolas Mitchell, senior investigative counsel for 17 HPSCI.\tMr. Mitchell and I will be conducting most of the 18 interview for the majority. 19 And I will now let my counterparts who will be ask i ng 20 any questions introduce themselves. 21 MR. CASTOR:\tGood morning, Ambassador.\tMy name is Steve 22 Castor, I'm a staffer with the Oversight and Government 23 Reform Committee, minority staff. 24 MR. BREWER:\tGood morning.\tI'm David Brewer from 25 Oversight as well.  11     MR. GOLDMAN:\tThis deposition will be conducted entirely 2 at the unclassified leve l.\tHowever, the deposition is being 3 conducted in HPSCI's secure space s, and i n the presence of 4 staff who all have appropriate security clearances.\tIt is 5 the committee's expectation that neither questions asked of 6 the witness nor answers by the witness or the witness' 7 counsel will require discussion of any information that is 8 currently, or at any point could be properly classified under 9 executive order 13526. 10 Moreover, E0-13526 states that, quote, \"in no case shall I I\ti nf ormat i on be classified, continue to be maintained as 12 classified, or fail to be declassified,\" unquote, for the 13 purpose of concea l i ng any violations of law or preventing 14 embarrassment of any person or entity.\tIf any of our 15 questions can only be answered with classified information, 16 Ambass ado r Yovanovitch, we'd ask you to inform us of that and 17 we will adjust acco rd i ngly . 18 I would also just note for the record that my 19 understanding is that Ambassador Yovanovitch's counsel also 20 has the necessary security clearances .\tIs t hat r i gh t? 21 1\tMR. ROBBINS:\tThat is correct. 22 MR. GOLDMAN:\tAll right.\tToday's dep osi ti on is not 23 being taken in executive session, but because of the 24 sensitive and confidential nature of some of the topics and 25 materials that will be discussed, access to the transcript of    12     the deposition will be limited to three committees in 2 attendance.\tYou and your attorney will have an opportunity 3 to review the transcript as well.\tPer the House rules for 4 this deposition, no members or staff may discuss the contents 5 of this deposition outside of the three committees, including 6 in public. 7 Before we begin, I'd like to briefly go over the ground 8 rules for this deposition.\tWe'll be following the House 9 regulations for depositions.\tWe have previously provided 10 your counsel with a copy of those regulations, and we have II copies here if you would like to review them at any time. 12 The deposition will proceed as follows: 13 The majority will be given 1 hour to ask questions and 14 then the minority will be given 1 hour to ask questions. 15 Ther eafter , we will alternate back and forth between majority 16 and minority in 45-minute rounds until questioning is 17 complete.\tWe will take periodic breaks, but if you need a 18 break at any time, please let us know. 19 Under the House deposition rules, counsel for other 20 persons or government agencies may not attend.\tAnd we can 21 point you to the deposition rule if anyone would like to look 22 at it.\tYou are allowed to have an attorney present during 23 this deposition, and I see that you have brought th r ee.\tAnd 24 at th i s time, if counsel could state their names for the 25 record.  13    MR. ROBBINS:\tSo I'm Lawrence Robbins from the firm of 2 Robbins Russell, representing the Ambassador.\tWith me are 3 Laurie Rubenstein and Rachel Li Wai Suen, also from our firm, 4 also for the witness. 5 MR. GOLDMAN:\tThere is a stenographer. or two. taking 6 down everythihg that is said here in order to make a written 7 record of the deposition.\tFor the record to be clear, please 8 wait until the questions are finished before you begin your 9 answer, and we will wait until you finish your response 10 before asking the next question.\tThe stenographer cannot II\trecord nonverbal answers. such as shaking your head.\tSo i t 12 is important that you answer each question with an audible 13 verbal answer. 14 We ask that you give complete replies to questions based 15 on your best recollection.\tIf the question is unclear or you 16 are uncertain in your response, please l et us know.\tAnd if 17 you do not know the answer to a question or cannot remember, 18 simply say so. 19 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a 20 privilege that is recognized by the committee.\tIf you refuse 21 to answer a question on the bas i s of privilege, staff may 22 either proceed with the depos i ti on or seek a ruling fr om 23 Chairman Schiff on the objection during the deposition at a 24 time of the majority staff's choosing.\tIf the chair 25 overrules any such objection during the deposition, you are  14     required to answer the question.\tThese are the House 2 deposition rules. 3 Finally, you are reminded that it is unlawful to 4 deliberately prov i de f al se information to Members of Cong r ess 5 or staff.\tIt is i mperative\tthat you not only answer our 6 questions truthfully, but that you give full and complete 7 answers to all questions asked of you.\tOmissions may also be 8 considered false statements . 9 Now, as this deposition is under oath, Ambassador 10 Yovanov i tch , would you please raise your rig h t hand and stand II\tand you ' ll be sworn in.\tDo you swear or af fir m that the 12\ttestimony you are about to give is the whole truth and 1 3\tnothing but the truth? 14\tMS. YOVANOVITCH:\tI do. 1 5\tMR . GOLDMAN :\tThank you.\tThe record will refl ect that 16 the witness has been duly sworn, and you may be sea ted.\tNow, 17 Ambassador Yovanovitch, I understa nd you have some openi ng 18 r emar ks and now is the time to do them. 19 MS. YOVANOVITCH:\tThank you.\tCha ir man Schiff, 20 Mr. J ordan , and other members and staff who are here today . 21 I really do thank you for the opportunity to start with a 22 statement.\tAnd I'd like to introduce myself.\tFor the 23 last -- for the last 33 years, it's been my great honor to 24 serve the American people as a Foreign Service Offi ce r over 25 six adm i n i stra ti ons. four Republican and two Democrat .\tI  15    have served in seven different count ri es; five of them have 2 been hardship posts, and I was appointed to serve as an 3 ambassador three times, twice by a Republican President, once 4 by a Democratic President. 5 Throughout my career, I have stayed true to the oath 6 that Foreign Service Officers take and observe every day, 7 that I  will support and defend th e Const i tut i on of the United 8 States against all enemies, foreign and domest i c, and that I 9 will bear tr ue faith and allegiance to the same.\tLi ke all 10 Foreign Service Officers with whom I have been privileged to II\tserve, I have understood that oath as a commitment to serve 1 2\ton a strictly nonpartisan basis, to advance the foreign 13 3\tpolicy determined by the i ncumben t Pre si dent , and to work at 14 all t i mes to strengthen our national secu r i ty and promote our 15 national i nterests . 16 I come by these beliefs honestly and thr ough personal 17 experience.\tMy parents fled Comm un i st and Nazi regimes.\tAnd 18 having seen, firsthand, the war and poverty and displacement 19 common to totalitarian r egi mes , they valued the freedom and 20 de mocra cy the U.S. offers, and tha t the United States 21 r epresent s.\tAnd they raised me to cher i sh those values as 22 well. 23 Their sacrifice allowed me to attend P r i ncet on 24 University, whe re I focused my studies on the former Soviet 25 Union.\tAnd gi ve n my upbr i ng i ng and my background, it has  16     been the honor of a lifetime to help to foster those 2\tprinciples as a career Foreign Service Officer.\tFrom 3\tAugust 2016 until May 2019. I served as the U.S. Ambassador 4 to Ukraine.\tOur policy, fully embraced by Democrats and 5 Republicans alike. was to help Ukraine become a stable and 6 independent democratic state, with a market economy 7 int eg r ated into Europe.\tUkraine is a sovereign country whose 8 borders a re i n vi ol ate , and whose people have the rig h t to 9 determine their own d esti ny.\tThese ar e the bedrock 10 principles of our policy. 11 Because of Ukra i ne's geostrategic position bordering 1 2\tRussia on its east, the warm waters of the oi l-r i ch Black Sea 13 to i ts south, and four NATO allies to its west, it i s 14 critical to the security of the United States that Ukraine 15 remain free and democrat i c, and that it continue to resi st 16 Russian expansi on i sm. 17 Russia's purported annexation of Crimea, i ts invasion of 18 Eastern Ukraine, and its de facto control ove r the Sea of 19 Azov , make clear Russ i a' s malign intentions towards Ukra i ne. 20 If we allow Ru ssi a's actions to stand, we will set a 21 pr ecedent that the United States wi l l regret for decades to 22 come. 23 So supporting Ukra i ne' s integration into Europe and 24 combat i ng Russia's efforts to destabilize Ukrain e have 25 anchored our policy since the Ukra i ni an people protested on  17     the Maidan i n 2014 and demanded to be a part of Europe and 2 live according to the rule of law.\tThat was U.S. pol i cy when 3 I became ambassador in August 2016, and it was reaffirmed as 4 that policy as the policy of the current administration in 5\tearly 2017. 6 The Revolution of Dignity and the Uk r a i ni an pe ople ' s 7 deman d to end corruption forced the new Ukrainian Government 8 to ta ke measures to fight the rampant corruption that long 9 permeated that country's political and econom i c systems.\tWe 10 have long understood that strong anti-corruption efforts must II\tform an essential part of our po licy\tin Ukraine, and now 12 there was a window of opportunity to do just exactly that. 13 And so why is that i mp ortan t?\tAnd why is it important 14 to us?\tPut simply, anti-corruption efforts serve Ukra in e' s 15 i ntere sts, but they also serve ours as well.\tCorrupt leaders 16 are inherently less trustworthy, while honest and accountable 17 Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukraine partnership more 18 reli able and more valuable to us .\tA level play i ng f i eld in 19 this strategically located country, one with a Eu r opean 20 landmass exceeded only by Russia, and with one of the la r ges t 21 populations in Europe, creates an environment in which U.S. 22 business can make more easily trade, invest, and profit. 23 Corruption is a security issue as well because corrupt 24 officials are vulnerable to Moscow.\tIn short, it is in our 25 national security interest to help. Ukra in e t r ansf orm i nto a    18     country where the rule of law governs and corruption is held 2 in check. 3 But change takes time, and the aspiration to instill 4 rule of law of values has still not been fulfilled.\tSince 5 2014, Ukraine has been at war, not just with Russia, but 6 within itself, as political and economic forces compete to 7 determine what kind of country Ukraine will become.\tThe same 8 old oligarch-dominated Ukraine where corruption is not just 9 prevalent, but frankly is the system.\tOr the country that 10 Ukrainians ·demanded\tin the Revolution of Dignity.\tA country 11 where rule of law is the system, corruption is tamed, and 12 people are treated equally, and according to the law. 13 During the 2019 pres i dent i al elections in Ukraine, the 14 people answered that quest i on once again.\tAngered by 15 insufficient progress in the fight against corruption, 16 Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly voted for a man who said that 17 ending corruption would be his number one priority.\tThe 18 transition, however. created fear among the political elite, 19 setting the stage for some of the issues I expect we will be 20 discussing today. 21 Understanding Ukraine's recent history, including the 22 significant tension between th ose who seek to transform the 23 country, and those who wish to continue profiting from the 24 old ways, i s, I believe, of ·criti cal importance to  25 understanding the events you asked me here today to de scribe.  19    Many of these events, and the false narratives that emerge 2 from them, resulted from an unfortunate alliance between 3 Ukrainians who continue to operate within a cor r upt system 4 and Americans who either did not understand that system, that 5 corrupt system. or who may have chosen, for their own 6 purposes. to ignore it. 7 It is seems obvious, but I think bears stating under the 8 circumstances, that when dealing with officials from any 9 country, or those claiming contacts -- or connections to 10 officialdom, one must understand their background, their II\tpersonal interest, and what they hope to get out of that 12 particular interaction before deciding how to evaluate their 13 description of events or acting on their information. 14 To be clear, Ukraine is full of people who want the very 15 th i ngs we have always said we want for the United States, a 16 government that acts in the interest of the people, a 17 government of the people, by the people, for the people.\tThe 18 overwhelming support for President Zelensky in April's 19 election proved that.\tAnd it was one of our most important 20 tasks at the embassy in Kyiv to understand and act upon the 21 difference between those who sought to serve their people and 22 those who sought to serve only themselves. 23 With that background in mind, I would like to briefly 24 address some of the specific issues raised in the press that 25 I ant i ci pate you may ask me about today.\tSo just to repeat.  20     I arrived in Ukraine on August 22, 2016, and I left Ukra i ne 2 permanently on May 20, 2019. Several of the events with 3 which you may be concerned occurred before I was even in the 4 country before I was ambassador. Here are just a few: 5 The release of the so-called Black Ledger, and Mr . 6 Manafort's subsequent resignation from the Trump campaign. 7 The Embassy's April 2016 letter to the Prosecutor Ge neral ' s 8 Office about the investigation into the Anti-Corruption 9 Acti on Center or AntAC. And the departure from office of IO\tformer Prosecutor General Viktor Shakin, who I have never II\t\tmet. These events all occurred before I arrived. 12 There are several events that occurred after I was 13 recalled from Ukraine. These include President Trump's 14\tJuly 25th call with President Zelensky; all of the many 15 discussions that have been in the press sur rounding that 16 phone call; and any d i scussi on surrounding the reported delay 17 of security assistance to Ukraine in summer 2019. So that 18 happened after I depa rt ed. 19  20 21  22  23  24 25  21    As for the events during my tenure in Ukraine.\tI really want 2 to make clear and I want to categorically state that I have 3 never , myself or through others, d ir ect ly or i nd i rectly , ever 4 directed, suggested , or in any other way asked , for any S\tgovernment or governme nt offic i al in Ukraine or elsewhere to 6 refrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption. 7 As Mr. Lutsenko, the form er Ukraine prosecutor general, 8 has recently acknowledged, the notion that I created or 9 disseminated or verbally told him a do-not-prosecute l i st is 10 completely false.\tAnd that is a story that M r. Lutsenko II\thimself has since retracted. 12 Equally f i cti ti ous is the notion that I am d i sloyal to 13 Pr es i dent Trump.\tI have heard the al legat i on i n the media 14 that I supposedly told our em ba ssy team to ignore the 15 President's orders since he was goi ng to be impeached.\tThat 16 allegation is false.\tI have never sa i d suc h a th i ng to my 17 embassy colleagues or anyone else. 18 Next, the Obama administration did not ask me to help 19 the Cl i nt on campaign, or harm the Tr ump campa i gn , and if they 20 had, I would never have taken any such steps.\tI have never 21 met Hunter Biden, nor have I had any direct or i ndi re ct 22 conversations wi th him.\tOf course , I have met former Vice 23 P resi dent Biden several times over the course of our many 24 years in government, but neither he nor the previous 25 administration ever directly or indirectly raised the issue  22     either of Burisma or Hunter Biden with me. 2 With respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have only had minimal 3 contact with him, a total of three that I\trecall.\tNone 4 related to the events at issue.\tI do not know Mr. Giuliani 's 5 motives for attacking me.\tBut individuals who have been 6 named in the press who have contact with Mr. G i ul i an i may 7 well have believed that their personal and financial 8 ambi ti ons were stymied by\tour anti-corruption poli cy in 9 Ukraine. 10 F i na lly , after being asked by the Department in early 11\tMarch to extend my tour, to stay on an extra year until 2020, 12 in late April, I was then abruptly asked to come back to 13 Washington from Ukraine on the next plane.\tYou will 14 understandably\twant to ask why my posting ended so suddenly . 15 I   wanted to\tlearn that, too, and I tr i ed to find out. 16 I met wi th the Deputy Sec r etary of State, who informed 17 me of the curtailment of my term.\tHe said that the President 18 had lost confidence in me, and no longer wished me to ser ve 19 as an ambassador.\tHe added that there had been a concerted 20 campaign against me, and that the Department had been under 21 pressure from the President to remove me since the summer of 22 2018.\tHe also sa i d that I had done nothing wrong, and that  23 this was not like other situations where he had recalled 24 ambassadors for cause. I departed Ukraine for good this past 25 May.   23    Although I understand, everyone understands, that I 2 served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless 3 incredulous that the U.S. Government chose to remove an 4 ambassador based, as far as I can tell. on unfounde d and 5 false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\tTo 6 make matte r s worse, all of this occurred during an especially 7 challenging time in bilateral relat i ons with a newly elected 8 Ukrainian President.\tThis was precisely the time when  9 continuity at the U.S . Embassy in Ukra i ne was most needed. 1 0\t\tBefore I close, I must share with you the deep II\tdisappointment and dismay I have felt as these events have 12 unfolded.\tI have served this Nation honorably for more than 13 30 years.\tI have proudly promoted and served American 14 interests as the representative of the American people and 15 six different Presidents over the last three decades. 16 Throughout that time, I, like my colleagues at the State 17 Depa rtm ent, have always believed that we have enjoyed a 18 sacred trust with our government. 19 We make a difference every day.\tAnd I know many of you 20 have been out to embassies around the world, and you know 21 that to be true.\tWhether it's a matter of war and peace, 22 trade and investment, or simply helping an American citizen 23 with a lost passport.\tWe repeatedly uproot our lives, and we 24 frequently put ourselves in ha r m' s way to serve our Nation, 25 and we do that willingly, because we believe in America and  24     its special role in the world. 2 We also believe that in return, our government will have 3 our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign 4 i nt erests . 5 That basic understanding no longer holds true.\tToday, 6 we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from 7 within.\tState Department leadership with Congress needs to 8 take action now to defend this great institution, and its 9 thousands of loyal and effective employees.\tWe need to 10 rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance Amer i ca ' s II\tinterest, and the front line of America's defense.\tI fear 12 that not doi ng so will harm our Nati on' s interest, perhaps 13 irreparably.\tThat harm will come not just through the 14 inevitable and continuing resi gnat i on and loss of many of 15 this Nati on' s most loyal and talented public ser vant s.\tIt 16 also will come when those d i plomat s who soldier on and do 17 their bes t to rep r esent our Nati on, face partners abroad who 18 question whether the ambassador really speaks for the 19 President, and can be counted upon as a reliable partner. 20 The harm will come when private interests circumvent 21 pr ofessi onal diplomats for the i r own ga i n , not for the public 22 good.\tThe harm will come when bad actors and countries 23 beyond Ukraine see how easy it i s to use f i ct i on and innuendo 24 to manipulate our system.\tIn such circumstances, the only 25 interests that are going to be served are those of our  25    strategic adversaries like Russia, that spread chaos and 2 attack the institutions and norms that the U.S. helped create 3 and which we have benefited from for the last 75 years. 4 I am proud of my work in Ukraine.\tThe U.S. Embassy 5 under my leadership represented and advanced the policies of 6 the United States Government as articulated first by the 7 Obama administration, and then by the Trump administration. 8 Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in 9 thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine who fought back by 10 selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would II\t\tlisten.\tSadly, someone was listening, and our Nation is 12 worse off for that. 13 So I want to thank you for your attention, and I welcome 14 your questions.\tThank you. 15 THE CHAIRMAN:\tThank you very much for your testimony. 16 Mr. Goldman . 17 MR. ROBBINS:\tExcuse me, just before we begin.\tPardon 18 me, I have a terrible cold this morning and I apologize if 19 I'm hard to hear.\tMr. Chairman, I' d just like to put the 20 following on the record before we begin today's depos i t i on. 21 As you know, the Department of State, in which the 22 ambassador is still employed, has asserted that its lawyers 23 should be allowed to attend this deposition so that they can 24 assert privileges or objections the Department might wish to 25 assert on behalf of the executive branch.\tAs we have told  26     both State Department lawyers and committee lawyers, it is 2 not our place to get in the middle of that or to take sides 3 in a dispute between the Congress and the executive branch, 4 and we don't intend to. 5 Ambassador Yovanovitch has been subpoenaed to testify, 6 and as we read the law, she is obliged to be here and 7 testify, and she wi11.\tWe have repeatedly asked the State 8 Department's office of the legal advisor to provide us with a 9 written statement that we could read on their behalf so that 10 their concer ns regarding what they term, quote, \"execut i ve II\t\tbranch con f i d ential i ty interests,\" end quote, could be heard 12 by this committee.\tWe have asked them to specify in writing 13 particular topics with r espect to which they wish us to point 14 out their interests.\tAnd although we were told we would 15 receive such a statement, we have not. 16 So that Ambassador Yovanovitch can be as diligent as 17 possible in complying with her employer's wishes, I will do 18 my best, during the course of this hearing, to point out t9\tquestions that might elicit information that I understand to 20 fall within the scope of their concerns.\tI wi l l also tell 21 you now that the Department told us that they don't want our 22 appearance today to be constru ed as a waiver of any 23 privileges they may hold. 24 I\twant to be clear that I\tam not asserting any of those 25 pr i v i leges on the client's behalf because, of course, we  27    don't have a right to assert those privileges at all.\tIf 2 they exist, they belong to the Department, and we will, of 3 course, make those objecti ons subject to whatever ruling the 4 chair chooses to make in the wake of those objections. 5 And with that on the record, I turn this over to counsel 6 for the majority. 7 THE CHAIRMAN:\tThank you.\tMr. Goldman. 8 MR. GOLDMAN:\tThank you, Mr. Chairman.\tThank you for 9 that opening statement, Ambassador Yovanovitch.\tI think 10 everyone recognizes and appreciates your long service to this II\tcountry. 12 EXAMINATION 13 BY MR. GOLDMAN: 14 Q\tWe are going to get into the circumstances 15 surrounding your abrupt removal, but in order, I think, to 16 fully understand that, we need to back up a little bit.\tAnd 17 I want to focus at the outset on press reports and other 18 indications of Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine. 19 When did you first become aware that Rudy Giuliani had 20 an interest in or was communicating with anyone in Ukraine? 21 A\tProbably around November , December timeframe of 22\t2018. 23 Q\tAnd describe those circumstances when you first 24 learned about it. 25 A\tBasically, it was people in the Ukrainian  28     Government who said that Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor 2 general, was in communi cat i on with Mayor Giuliani, and that 3 they had plans, and that they were go i ng to, you know, do 4 th i ng s, including to me. 5 Q\tSo you first heard about it from the Ukrainian 6 officials? 7 A\tThat' s correct. 8 Q\tDid you understand how they were aware of this 9 information? 10 A\tSo I can tell you what I think, you know, this is II\tperhaps not a fact.\tBut the i mpre ssi on that I received is 12 that Mr. Lutsenko was talking rather freely about this in, 13 you know, certain circles, and so others heard about it who 14 wanted to let us know. 1 5\tTHE CHAIRMAN:\tCan you move the microphone a little 16 closer. 17 MS. YOVANOVITCH:\tSorry. }8\tBY MR. GOLDMAN: 19 Q\tWere these Ukrainian Government officials?  20 A 21 Q  Yes. Can you describe for us who the former Prosecutor  22 Ge ner al Lutsenko i s, and give us some context as to his 23 background and what your assessment of him is? 24 A\tYeah , he's a Ukrainian politician.\tHe' s been in 25 politics I would say, probably, the last 20 years or so, and  29    he has held many high government positions.\tHe's a political 2 ally of former Presi dent\tPoroshenko, or at least was until 3 the time I left, I don't know where that status is now.\tAnd 4 he is a man who was the head of the Poroshenko faction and 5 the Rada, which is the Ukrainian parliament, until the spring 6 of 2016 when he was voted in to become the prosecutor 7 general. 8 Q\tIs he a lawyer? 9 A\tNo. IO\tQ\tSo how did he become the prosecutor general? II\tA\tBecause the Rada had to take a prior vote that 12 would allow that exception, which I believe is act ually even 13 in the constitution, either cons titut i on or law. 14 4\tQ\tSo he was the prosecutor genera l the entire time 15 that you were in Ukraine.\tIs that right?   16 A  17 Q  That's correct. And can you just describe bri efly what the role of  18 the prosecutor general is in Ukra i ne? 19 A\tYes.\tAnd because Uk r a i ne is a country in 20 transition, that role was i n the process of becoming 21 reformed.\tSo the prosecutor general ' s office i s, or 22 position, is a very powerfu l one, it's a hold-over from the 23 Soviet Union days.\tAnd that individual is in cha rg e of both 24 investigatory actions, like the FBI, for example, as well as 25 the actual prosecution.\tSo it' s tremendous power.    30     And Mr. Lut senko was bro ught in to reform that off i ce to 2 spl i t the off i ces , investigatory and prosecuto r i al , a nd to 3 make real reform s so that -- because the PGO, Prosecutor 4 Gene ral ' s Offi ce , was v i ewed as an instrument of corruption 5 bas i cally , to grant people favors, they cou l d open cases, 6 t hey could close cases based on money pass i ng hands or 7 whatever was most opportune, and it trickled down to the 8 ordin ary people ' s lives as well.\tSo it was seen as a place  9 where ironically co r rupt i on thrived and he was brought\tin to 10 clean that up. 11 Q\tWas he successful in clean i ng that up? 12 A\tNo. 13 Q\tHow would you assess his character? 14 A\tHe's very smart.\tHe can be very charming.\tHe , I 15 th i nk , i s an opportunist and will ally h i msel f , somet i mes 16 si multane ously, I believe, with whatever pol i ti cal or 17 econom i c forces he believes will suit his i nte r ests best at 18 the ti me .  19 Q 20 A  Would you call him someone who is corrupt? I have cer ta i nly heard a lot of people call him  21 co r r upt , and there are certainly a lot of stories about his 22 actions that would indicate that. 23 Q\tYou mentioned in your opening statement that the re 24 were false statements that were spread about you .\tWas he one 25 of the i nd i v i dua ls who spread those false statements about  31    you? 2 A\tYes. 3 Q\tNow, let's go back to first learning about Rudy 4 Gi ul i an i 's involvement.\tWhat did you understand in late 2018 5 to be Mr. Giuliani's interest in Ukraine? 6 A\tI wasn't really sure, but he had cli ent s in 7 Ukraine, so that was one possible th i ng .\tBut he also 8 obviously is the Pre si dent 's personal lawyer.\tSo I wasn't 9 really sur e what exactly was going on.   10  11\twas? 12  Q\tDid you come to lea r n what his i nt erest in Ukraine   A\tWell, you know, I read the press and watch TV just   13 like everybody else in this room, so yeah, I learned. 14 Q\tDid you have any further con ver sat i ons with 15 Ukrainian Government officials about Mr. Giuliani's 16 activities in Ukraine? 17 A\tYes, I did.\tMost of the conversations were not 18 with me directly, people on the embassy staff, but yes, I did 19 have othe r conversat i ons. 20 Q\tAnd from your staff members or your own 21 conversations, what did you come to learn about 22 Mr. G i ulian i ' s interest in Ukraine? 23 A\tThat basically there had been a number of meetings 24 between Mr. Lut senk o and Mayor Giuliani, and that they were 25 l ook i ng -- I should say that Mr. Lutsenko was looking to hurt  32     me in the U.S.\tI couldn't imagine what that was.\tBut, you 2 know, now I see. 3 Q\tWhat do you see now? 4 A\tWell, that I'm no longer in Ukraine. 5 Q\tFair enough.\tBut describe the evolution of your 6 understanding as to how Mr. Lutsenko was trying to hurt you 7 in the U.S.? 8 A\tI think, and again, I am getting this partly from 9 conversations with people who may or may not know what really 10 happened, as well as what has been in the media, both in 11 Ukraine and here in the United States.\tSo I' ll tell you what 12 I think.\tI can't say that -- 13 Q\tLet me just interrupt you there.\tIs some of your 14 knowledge based on Mr. Giuliani's statements himself? 15 A\tTo the press. 16 Q\tOkay. 17 A\tSo I th i nk tha t there was -- Mr. Lutsenko was not 18 pleased that\tthat we continued at the embassy to call for 19 cleaning up the PGO. the Prosecutor General's Office, and he 20 came into office with, you know. three goals:\tOne was to 21 reform the office, one was to prosecute those who killed the 22 innocent people on the Maidan during the Revolut i on of 23 Dignity, and one was to prosecute money laundering cases to 24 get back the $40 billion-plus that the previous president and 25 his cronies had absconded with.\tNone of those things were  33    done.\tAnd we thought those were great goals. and we wanted 2 him to encourage him to continue with those goals.\tThat did 3 not happen. 4 And so. we continued to encourage him, and I don't think 5 he r eally appreciated it.\tWhat he wanted from the U.S. 6 Embassy was for us to set up meetings wi th the Attorney 7 General, with the Director of the FBI , et cetera.\tAnd he 8 would say, I have important information for them.\tAs perhaps 9 many of you know, there are, you know, usual processes for 10 that kind of thing.\tWe don't have principals meet and, you 11 know, the foreign principal springs new information that may 12 or may not be valid to an American cabinet member, we just 13 don ' t do that. 14 And so what we kept on encouraging him to do was to meet 15 wi th the legat, the legal attache, the FBI at the embassy. 16 That is precisely why we have the FBI in countries overseas, 17 to work with host country counterparts and get information, 18 whatever that information might be, develop cases, et cetera. 19 He didn't want to share that i nf ormat i on.\tAnd now, I think I 20 understand that that information was falsehoods about me. 21 Q\tWhat falsehoods about you? 22 A\tWell, for example, as I mentioned i n the testimony, 23 in the statement, the opening statement, that I gave him a 24 do-not-prosecute list, a list of individuals that he should 25 not touch.  34     Q\tAnd did you do that?  2 A\tNo. 3 Q\tDid you learn whether there was any additional 4 i nf ormat i on that he wanted to share wi th U.S. Government 5 off i ci als ? 6 A\tWell, I think, you know, it was other th i ngs along  7 that li ne. 8 Q\tOne of the things that has been publicized quite  9 si gni f i cantly is information that Prosecuto r General Lutsenko 10\tmay have had i n connect i on to ei ther Paul Manafort or the 11 2016 election? 12 A\tUh- huh . 1 3\tQ\tDid you come to learn anything about either of 14 those topics? 15 A\tHe d i dn ' t share anything with me. 16 Q\tDid he share anything with any other Ukra i ni an 17 officials that you then learned about it from, or learned 18 about this f rom? 19 A\tI think, yeah, I th i nk they may have been aware 20 that that was more broadly what he also might sh are with 21 M r. Giuliani. . 22 Q\tWell, let me ask the question this way:\tOther than  23 i nformat i on about you -- 24 A\tUh-huh . 25 Q\t-- what other information did you come to learn  35    while you were at post about what Mr. Lutsenko wanted to 2 share with American officials? 3 MR. ROBBINS:\tSo you're asking now while she was 4 ambassador as opposed to things she' s read in the paper and 5 media since she was recalled? 6 BY MR. GOLDMAN: 7 Q\tYes, I'm asking while you were there, what did you 8 understand? 9 A\tYeah, it was very amorphous, because while there 10 was sort of that gossip out there, the gossip that I was 11 going to be recalled, and you know, people would ask me, and 12 I' d say No, no, I' m he re, I' m worki ng.\tBut i t was ve ry I 3\tamorphous, and so at the time, I d i dn 't know.\tWhen i t became 14 clearer was on March 24th with the publication of The Hill 15 interview with Mr. Lutsenko. 16 So that, you know , that was sort of the first kind of 17 public, on the record, in the United States, and then over 18 the ensuing days there was more in the U.S. media, 19 Mr. Gi ul i an i spoke publ i cly , and Donald Trump Jr. also 20 tweeted that I should be rem oved . 21 Q\tSo let's separate out your removal from any of the 22 other information. 23 A\tOkay. 24 Q\tBecause we are going to get to your removal , and 25 we're goi ng to focus on that.\tBut just to get the lay of the  36     land here.\tWhat did you -- when you referenced The Hill, 2 what did you come to learn from The Hill about information 3 that Lutsenko was trying to share? 4 A\tWell, I   think, I mean, I th i nk. I've already told 5 you.\tSo he shared information that there was -- he raised  6 questions -- again, this happened before I arrived, but he 7 raised questions about U.S. Government assistance to the PGO, 8 and whether there was a discrepancy in the funding and 9 whether he should be investigating it, and that the embassy 10 had assured him, again, before I arrived, that we had fully 11 accounted for all U.S. funds, and that we were not concerned 12 about this.\tSo that was one line that he talked about. 13 There was the do-not-prosecute list.\tThere was. I mean, you 14 know, a number of issues. 15 Q\tWas there anything about the 2016 election or Paul 16 Manafort? 17 A\tI\tthink, yeah, I\tthink that was in The Hill article  18 as well. 19 Q\tAnd what about former Vice President Joe Biden or 20 Burisma? 21 A\tI think that was in the article as well. 22 Q\tSo after you learned about this in The Hill, did 23 you have any additional conversations with people, either 24 Americans in the embassy, or Ukrainian officials about the 25 reports?  37    A\tWell, in the embassy we were trying to figure out 2 what was going on.\tI also, of course, was in touch with 3 folks in Washington at the NSC, and at the State Department 4 to try to figure out what was this, what was going on. 5 Q\tWhat did you learn? 6 A\tNot much.\tI mean, I think people were not sure. 7 On the 25th, the day after The Hill article came out, the 8 State Department had a pretty strong statement that said that 9 Mr. Lutsenko's allegations were a fabr i cat i on, and then, you 10 know, over the weekend, there was a lot more in the media. 11 And, you know, the State Department was trying to figure out 12 how to respond, I think, during that time and the following 13 week.\tBut I didn't get very much information. 14 Q\tAt that point, were you aware that Mr. Gi ul i an i had 15 met with Mr. Lutsenko previous ly? 16 A\tYeah, I think it became pretty clear. 17 Q\tWhat do you mean by that? 18 A\tBecause I think it was in the media, and I think 19 they said it. 20 Q\tSo at this point, just so we' re clear.\tMr. 21 Giuliani was never an employee of the State Department, 22 right? 23 A\tNot to my knowledge. 24 Q\tYou said that you met with him, I think, three 25 times.\tCan you describe those meetings?  38     A\tUh-huh. 2 THE CHAIRMAN :\tJust ask -- before we get to that, 3 counse l.\tDid you know at the time or have you learned since 4 why Mr. Lutsenko was engaged in pushing out these smears 5 against you?\tWhy did he want to get rid of you? 6 MS. Y0VAN0VI TCH:\tWell, again, I can tell you what I 7 think, but I don't know for a fact. 8 THE CHAIRMAN:\tYou know, based on what you' ve learned 9 from colleagues, what you've learned in the press, what is 10 your best understanding of why Lutsenko was tr y i ng to push II\tyou out of Ukraine? 12 MS. Y0VA N0V ITCH:\tI think that he felt that I and the 13 embassy were effective at helping Ukrainians who wanted to 14 reform, Ukrainians who wanted to fight against co rrupt i on , 15 and he did not -- you know , that was not in his interest.\tI 16 th i nk also that he was, I mean, i t's hard to bel i eve , I think 17 he was personally angry with me that we weren't -- we did 18 work with the PGO's office, but he wanted us to work with him 19 in different ways, you know. and that we d i dn' t have a closer 20 relationship, and that I was not facilitating trips for him 21 to the United States with our cabinet members, when there 22 was, frankly, nothing to tal k about because he wasn't a good 23 partner for us. 24 THE CHAIRMAN:\tYou had mentioned earli er that you were 25 try i ng to make sure that Ukrainian officials used proper  39     legal channels -- 2 MS. YOVANOVITCH: 3 THE CHAIRMAN:    Yes. if they had information that they  4 wanted to share with U.S. law enforcement? 5 MS. YOVANOVITCH:\tRight. 6 THE CHAIRMAN:\tDo you think that your insistence or 7 advocacy for following the proper procedures in terms of 8 using legat and legal channels was part of the reason why he 9 wanted you removed? 10 MS. YOVANOVITCH:\tMaybe.\tMaybe.\tI mean , he clearly 11 wanted to work around the system where I think there's less 12 transparency, there are more opportunities to, you know, kind 13 of\tfiddle the system, shall we say. 1 4\tBY MR. GOLDMAN : 15 Q\tOkay.\tAnd when you say work around the system , did 16 you come to understand that that was a role that Mr. Giuliani 17 could play for him, for Mr. Luts enko? 18 A\tWell, now it certainly appears that way. 19 Q\tBut when did you come to understand that? 20 A\tYou know, now, you know, with the advantage of 21 hindsight, you're going to think that I'm incredibly naive, 22 but I couldn ' t imagine all of the things that have happened 23 over the last 6 or 7 months, I just couldn't im ag i ne it. 24 So we knew that there was something out there.\tWe were 25 ask i ng ourselves, you know, what is going on?\tBut then it  40     became clear with The Hill interview and all the subsequent 2 things that came out in the press. 3 Q\tSo the State Department issued a statement 4 essentially denying what was reported in The Hill? 5 A\tUh - huh . 6 Q\tDid you ever receive any pressure from anyone at 7 the State Department to reconsider your position or in any 8 way consider some of the advocacy of Mr. Giuliani? 9 A\tI don't quite understand the 10 Q\tI'm wondering if you got any messages or I I\tsuggestions or directions from the State Department that were 12 consistent with what Mr. Giuliani was discussing and what his 13 interests were? 14  15 16 information came out in The Hill in late March, you had a 17 number of conversations both with people in the embassy and 18 people back in Washington.\tWho were you speaking to within 19 the State Department about this issue? 20 A\tAssistant Secretary -- or Acting Assistant 21 Secretary Phil Reeker of the European Bureau, who is my boss. 22 I spoke once with David Hale, who is the Under Secretary for 23 Political Affairs.\tAnd at the NSC with Fiona Hill. 24 Q\tAnd what was the message that you generally 25 received from them?  41    A\tTotal support. 2 Q\tThey understood that this was a fabrication? 3 A\tYeah, I mean, until today, nobody has ever actually  4 asked me the question from the U.S. Government of whether I 5 am actually guilty of all of these things I'm supposed to 6 have done.\tNobody even asked, because I think everybody just 7 thought it was so outrageous. 8 Q\tDid you ever have any\tconversations after November, 9\tDecember 2018, with Ukrainian offi c i als about Mr. Giuliani up 10\tuntil the time that you left in May? II A\tI think perhaps in the February ti me period, I did 12 where one of the senior Ukrainian officials was very 13 concerned, and told me I really needed to watch my back .   14 4\tQ 15 A  Describe that conversation. Well, I mean, he basically said, and went into some  16 detail, that there were two i nd i viduals\tfrom Florida, 17 Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were working with Mayor 18 Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for 19 Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Lutsenko.\tAnd that they were 20 i nterested\tin having a different ambassador at post, I guess 21 for -- because they wanted to have business dealings in 22 Ukraine, or additional business dealings. 23 I didn't understand that because nobody at the embassy 24 had ever met those two individuals.\tAnd, you know , one of 25 the biggest jobs of an American ambassador of the U.S.  42  43  44  45    [11:39 a.1111.]  2 BY MR. GOLDMAN: 3 Q\tSo your understanding in February and your meeting 4 with Minister Avakov was that he was aware at that time of 5 Mr. Giuliani's interests in those topi cs?  6 A\tYes. 7 Q\tDid you have an understanding as to whether other  8 Ukrainian Government officials were also aware of 9 Mr. Giuliani's i nterest\tin those specific topics? 10 A\tI -- I got the impression that it was relatively II\topenly discussed at the very, very most senior levels, but 12 nobody else was sharing this with me at that time. 13 Q\tAnd so, was it your understand i ng that the Minister 14 Avakov or other senior Ukrainian officials were aware of  15 Mr. Giuliani's connection to President Trump? 16 A\tYes, everybody knew that. 17 Q\tWhat did they know? 18 A\tThat he was the Pre si dent's\tpersonal lawyer. 19 Q\tWas i t your understanding that they believed that 20 Rudy Giuliani spoke on behalf of, or for the President? 21 A\tI think -- I think they didn't know.\tI think they  22 hoped that he did, and   23 Q 24 A  Hoped that he did or didn't? Hoped -- well, the individuals who were meeting   25 with Mr. Giuliani certainly hoped that Mr. Giuliani was  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317 \n"

    unclassified\t  the chairman:\tthe committee will come to order.  good morning, dr. hill, and welcome to the house  permanent select committee on intelligence, which, along with  the foreign affairs and oversight committees, is conducting  this investigation as part of the official impeachment  inquiry of the house of representatives.\ttoday's deposition  is being conducted as part of that i nqui ry.  in light of attempts by the white house administration  to direct witnesses not to cooperate with the inquiry, the  committee had no choice but to compel your appearance today. ii\twe thank you for complying with the duly authorized  congressional subpoena.  dr. hill has served with distinction in and out of  government, including as national intelligence officer for  russia and eu rasi a at the national intelligence council, as a  senior fellow with the brookings institution, and, most  recently, as deputy assistant to the president and senior  director for europe and russia on the nati onal security  council staff.  in her most recent work at the white house, dr. hill  held a unique position at the top of the executive branch's  policymaking process, in which she would have had access to  and been involved in key policy discussions, meetings, and  decisions on ukraine that relate d i rectly to areas under  investigation by the committees.  unclassified\t  although you left your position, dr. hill, only a few  days before the president's july th, , call with  ukrainian president zelensky, we look forward to hearing your  testimony today about the range of issues and i nterac ti ons we  are investigating that occurred in the leadup to the  ju ly th call, as well as your expert assessment of the  evidence we have uncovered since you left the white house.  this includes the ju ly  call record itself as well as  the documentary record that has come to light about efforts  after the call to get the ukrainians to announce publicly  investigations into the two areas president trump asked  president zelensky to pursue, the bidens and burisma, and the  conspiracy about ukra i ne's purported interference in the   u.s. elections.  before i turn to committee counsel to begin the  deposition, i invite the ranking member nunes or, in his  absence, one of the republican members present to make any  opening remarks.\ti will recognize one of the gop members.  mr. j ordan:\tthank you, mr. chairman.  dr. hill, i want to thank you also for appearing today.  my understanding is you were coming voluntarily until about  an hour ago when the chairman issued to you a subpoena.  the chairman:\texcuse me, could we suspend?  do we have any members here that are not members of the  three committees authorized to be present?  unclassified\t    mr. gaetz, you're not permitted to be in the room.  mr. gaetz:\ti am on the judiciary committee.  the chairman:\tjudiciary committee is not a part of this  hearing.   mr. gaetz:\ti thought the judiciary committee had

please absent yourself from  the committee.\tit's the ruling of the chair you're not  permitted to be here.\tplease leave the commi ttee.  mr. jordan:\tmr. chairman, i think in the  hours of  testimony we've heard in the two previous interviews, there  have been a grand total of  members of congress present.\ti ii\tdon't think it's going to hurt to have a th member actually  hear something that , in my judgment, all  members of  congress should be entitled to hear.  the chairman:\tmr. gaetz, you' re not a member of the  three designated committees that are participating in this  interview.\tyou' re not permitted to be here.\tthat is the  ruling of the chair, and you are required to leave.  mr. gaetz:\tdo you have a rule that you' re able to cite  for that?  the chairman:\ti am ci ti ng the house rules and the  deposition rules.\tyou are not permitted to be here.  mr. gaetz:\twhich rule?  the chairman:\tmr. gaetz, you are simply delaying the  procedures in violation of the rules.\tplease absent  yourself.     unclassified\t  mr. gaetz:\twhich rule?  the chairman:\tmr. gaetz. why don't you take your  spectacle outside?\tthi s is not how we conduct ourselves in  this committee.  mr. gaetz:\ti've seen how you've conducted yourself in  this committee, and i'd like to be here to observe.  the chairman:\twe'll wait until mr. gaetz leaves before  we begin.\ti do want to say that this dilatory tactic will  come out of the minority's time for questi onin g.  mr. gaetz:\tthis isn't dilatory.\tyou can begin any time  you like.  the chairma n:\twe're going to begin the

parliamentarian, which was just relayed over the phone, to  both members and staff of the minority committees as well as  the majority.  the parliamentarian made clear that the house deposition  regulations and the language used therein has always been  construed as meaning membe rs of the committees undertaking ii\t\tthe joint i nvesti gati on and not members of other committees  who may wish to attend for other reasons, and, therefore,  they are not allowed to participate in the deposition itself  or be present.  thank you.  mr. jordan:\tchairman, could i just add one thing?  the chairman:\tyes.  mr. jordan:\tthe parliam entar i an was also clear that  there is no precedent, no basis for docking anyone's time,  that this was a legi tim ate question and not dilatory in any  sense.  the chairman:\tmr. jordan, you have an opening  statement?  mr. jordan:\ti do.  on september th, speaker pelosi unilaterally     unclassified\t  announced   the chairma n:\tthe record should reflect that mr. gaetz  has left the room.  mr. jordan:\tyes.  on september th, speaker pelosi uni lateral ly announced  that the house was beginning a socalled impeachment i nquir y.  on october nd, speaker pelosi promised that the socalled  impeachment inquiry would treat the president with fairness.  however, speaker pelosi, chairman schiff, and democrats  are not living up to that basic promise.\tinstead, democrats ii\tare conducting a rushed, closeddoor, and unpreceden ted  impeachment inquiry.\tdemocrats are ignoring  years of  bipartisan procedures, procedures that provided elements of  fundamental fairness and due process.  in past impeachment inquiries, the majority and the  mi norit y had coequal subpoena authority and the ri ght to  require a commi ttee vote on all subpoenas.\tthe presi dent's  counsel had a right to attend all depositions and hearings  including those held in executive session.\tthe president's  counsel had a right to crossexamine witnesses and a right to  propose witnesses.  the president's counsel also had the right to present  evidence, object to the admission of evidence, and to review  all evidence presented, both favorable and unfavorable.  speaker pelosi and chairman schiff's socalled impeachment  unclassif ied\t  inquiry has none of these guarantees of fundamental fairness  and due process.  most disappointing, democrats are conducting this  impeachment inquiry behind closed doors.\tthis seems to be  nothing more than hiding this work from the american people  and, frankly, as we just saw, hiding it from other members of  the united states congress.\tif democrats intend to undo the  will of the american people just before the next electi on,  they should at least do so transparently and be willing to be io\taccountable for their actions. ii\tand, fi nally, dr. hill, we've been advised by the state  department that communications between heads of state are  classified, and i think it's important that we keep that in  mind as we proceed through today's interview.  with that, i yield back.  the chairman:\tmr. goldman.  mr. goldman:\tthank you, mr. chai rman .  this is a deposition of dr. fiona hi ll conducted by the  house permanent select committee on intelli gence pursuant to  the impeachment i nquir y announced by the speaker of the house  on september th.  dr. hill, if you could please state your full name and  spell your last name for the record.  dr. hill:\tit's fiona hill.\tlast name is hill.  mr. goldman:\talong with other proceedings in     unclassifie d\t  furtherance of the inquiry, this deposition is part of a  joi nt i nvesti gati on led by the int elli gence committee in  coordination with the committees on foreign affairs and  oversi ght and reform.  in the room today are majority and minority staff from  both the forei gn affair s committees and the oversi ght  committees, as well as majority and minority staff from  hpsci.\tj ust so the record is clear, equal numbers of staff  from both the majority and minority have been and are  permitted to be he re. this is a staffled deposition, but ii\tmembe rs, of course, from the three committees may ask  questions du ri ng thei r all otted time.  my name is daniel goldman .\ti'm the director of  investigations for the hpsci majori ty staff, and i want to  thank you very much for corni ng in today for this dep osi ti on.  i would like to do brief introductions, and i understand  that the witness would also just like for everybody around  the table to introduce him or herself so that the witness  knows who everybody is.\tso, to my right is dani el noble, who  is the seni or investigative counsel for hpsci.\tmr. noble and  i wi ll be conducting most of the interview for the majority.  and then, if we could just continue down the room next  to mr. noble, that would be great. \t      \tmr. heck:\ti'm denny heck .\ti represent the th  unclassified\t district of washington state. \t      mr.

republican staff of  the oversight committee. \t        \tmr. wolosky:\ti' m lee wolosky, counsel to dr. hill.  \tmr. ungar:\ti'm sam ungar, also counsel for dr. hill.  dr. hill:\tthank you.  mr . goldman:\tdr. hill, this deposition will be  conducted entirely at the unclassified level.\thowever, the  deposi ti on is being conducted in hpsci's secure spaces and in     unclassified\t  the presence of staff who all have appropriate security  clearance.\tit is the committee's expectation that neither  questions asked of the witness nor answers by the witness or  the witness' counsel will require discussion of any  information that is curr ently or at any point could be  properly classified under executive order .  moreover, eo  states that, quote, in no case shall  information be classified, continued to be maintained as  classified, or fail to be declassified, unquote, for the  purpose of concealing any violations of law or preventing ii\tembarrassment of any person or entity.  now, i understand that, dr. hill, you had classification  authorization in your previous job.\tyou were the classifying  authori ty.\tso we expect you to fully understand the  distinction here between the classified and unclassified, and  we will be relying on you in part to indicate whether any  questions that are asked may call for answers that are  classified.  if that is the case, we would ask that you please inform  us of that before answering the questions so that we can  adjust accordingly.\tpart of the reason for that is our  understanding is that your attorneys do not have appropriate  security clearances   dr. hill:\tright.  mr. goldman:\t and so we'll want to make sure that we  unclassified\t  preserve all classi fi ed i nforma ti on in our nati onal securi ty  interests.  today' s deposition is not being taken in executive  session, but because of the sensitive and confidential nature  of some of the topics and materials that wi ll be discussed,  access to the transcript of the deposition wi ll be limited to  the three commi ttees in attendance.\tyou and your attorney  will have an opportunity to revi ew the transcript at a later  date.  before we begin, i'd like to go over a couple of ground ii\trules for this deposition.\twe will be following the house  regulati ons for deposi ti ons.\tas you know by now, we have  previously provided your counsel with a copy of the  regulati ons, and we have copies here as well if you or your  counsel would li ke to review them at any time.  the way this deposition will proceed i s as follows: the  majority will be given  hour to ask questions, and then the  minority wi ll be given  hour to ask questions, and,  thereaf ter , we will alter nat e back and forth between majority  and minority in  min ute rounds until the questioning is  complete.\twe will take periodic breaks, but if you or your  counsel need any break at any time, just let us know.  as we just understood, you do have counsel here, who  just introduced themselves.\tand so we want to make it clear  that, unde r the house deposition rules, counsel other than     unclassified\t  your own counsel, including counsel for government agencies, \tmay not attend.\tso it is our understanding that the only  counsel here today representing you is your personal counsel.  there is a stenographer taking down everything that is  said here today.\tfor the record to be clear, we would ask  that you please wait until questions are finished before you  answer, and we will do the same when you answer.\tthe  stenographer cannot record nonverbal answers, such as shaking  your head or saying uhhuh, so it is important that you  answer each question with an audible, verbal answer. ii\twe ask that you give complete replies to the questions  based on your best recollection.\tif a question is unclear or  you are uncertain in your response, please don' t hesitate to  let us know and ask that the question be rephrased or asked  aga i n.\tif you do not know the answer to a question or cannot  rememb er, simply say so.  you may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a  privilege that is recognized by the committee.\tif you refuse  to answer a question on the basis of privilege, staff may  either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the  chairman on the objection in person or by telephone during  the deposition at a time of the majo ri ty staff's choosi ng.  if the chair overrules any such objection, you are required  to answer the question.  and, finally, you are reminded that it is unlawful to  unclassified\t  deli berat ely provide false information to members of congress  or staff.\tit is imperative that you not only answer our  questions truthfully but that you give full and complete  answers to all questions asked of you.\tomissions may also be  considered to be false statements.  now, as this deposition is under oath, dr. hill, would  you please stand and raise your right hand to be sworn?\tdo  you answer or affirm that the testimony you are about to give  us is the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  dr. hill:\ti do.  mr. goldman:\tthank you.\tlet the record reflect that  the witness has been sworn.  dr. hill, if you choose, now is your time to make any  opening remarks.  dr. hill:\ti don't have any openings remarks.\ti'm just  here to answer everyone's questions.  mr. goldman:\tand, mr. wolosky, do you have anything  that you would like to address before we begin?  mr. wolosky:\tyes.\tthank you, mr. goldman.  i would like to enter into the record a letter of  today's date, october , , from michael purpura of the  white house counsel's office governing the subjects or  addressing the subjects of executive privilege and  classification, along with a letter from me to mr. purpura  dated october , .      unclassified\t  i'd like to make it clear that dr. hill is testifying  today subject to the contents of these letters or of the  white house counsel's office's letter, also pursuant to the  subpoena she received today, and pursuant to any rulings that  are made by the chair during the pendency of these  proceedings.  the chairman:\tthose lett ers will be admitted into the  record .      ii  ********  insert   ********                                                          unclassified\t  the chairman:\tin li ght of the white house counsel  letter introduced by the wi tness' counsel, let me state at  the outset of today' s testim ony that thi s testimony should  proceed without any i nterference or delay.  dr. hill, you are compelled to testify at this  deposition by a subpoena that the permanent select committee  on intelli gence issued to you today, october , .\tyou  are required to provide full, truthful , and accurate  testimony in connection with the commi ttee's joint  i nvesti gati on, which is undertaken as part of the house of  representatives' impeachment i nqu i ry.  your counsel has provided a letter sent to your counsel  this morning from the whi te house stating that the  i nformat i on that you may be asked to testify about today  could be covered by a privilege.\tunder the house deposition  rules, as the chair, i have the authori ty to rule on any such  objection, but no such objection wi ll be in order or should  be necessary.  as you know, only the presi dent may assert execu ti ve  pri vi lege, and the president usually does so in wri ti ng with  speci fi ci ty along with an opinion from the justice  department.\tthe president has not communicated any such  assert i on to the committee with respect to the i nformat ion  requested.  the president has also spoken extensively publicly about  unclassified\t  the matters under investigation here, and he has declassified  and publicly released a summary of his call with the  ukrainian president.\tthe administration also declassified  the whistleblower complaint and a range of accompanying  materials that address the range of issues under discussion  today.  the president's actions have opened the door to furthe r  investigative actions and taking of testimony on these  subjects.\tthe president has waived his ability to block  others from making statements about the same matters that ii\tcontradict his own statements or expose his wrongdoing.  regarding any claim of deliberative process privilege as  an element of executive privilege, this is not a privilege  recognized by the congress.\tfurthermore, the information you  have been asked to provide is critical to the committee's  i nvesti gati on and the house's impeachment inquiry.  we must obtain your answers here because congress has a  constitutional duty to expose wrongdoing in the executive and  to act as a check and balance to the power of the executive,  especi ally when there is significant evidence that the  president is abusing his executive power for his own personal  gain.\tthe commi ttees cannot accept any effort to interfere  with these proceedings.\twe therefore expect you do answer  all questions during the deposition.  with that, i will yield back to mr. goldman.  onclassified\t  mr. goldman:\tthank you.  by mr. goldman:  q\tdr. hill, could you please explain for everyone in  the room what your role was on the national security council?  a\tyes.\ti was the senior director who was overseeing  all of the interactions across the interagency pertaining to  europe, our european allies, including also the european  union and nato, and also including russia, turkey, and the  subject at hand, ukraine.  q\twhen did you join the nsc?  a\ti formally started on april rd of .  techni cally, it was april , but it was a weekend.  q\tand when did you depart the nsc?  a\ti departed the nsc physically on july th of this  year, .\ti handed over my duties on july th to my  successor, tim morrison, and i handed in my badge technically  on september rd of .\tbut i was actually on vacation, a  paid vacation from the nsc, from basically ju ly  all the  way through until handing in my badge again.\tmy last payday  was august th of .\tand i give this detailed answer  because i know that there's been some confusion as to when i  was physically there or what my actual tenure was.  q\tand from july th until september rd, what was  your access to email and other communications within the nsc?  a\ti had some limited access to unclassified email on     unclassified\t  my iphone, and that would have be under agreement with  ambassador bolton and with other nsc staff.\tbecause of the  short handover to tim morrison, there were concerns that  emails would come into me directly because i'd been there  since the beginning essentially of the administration, and  they wanted to make sure that if i was the only person  getting an email, that it wasn't lost and could be forwarded  on.  q\tokay.\tand prior to joining the nsc, can you just  give us a brief overview of your professional experience. ii\ta\ti have been working on issues related to russia  since i was an undergraduate at university back in the s.  and, actually, i first started in a professional way working  on russiarelated issues, including actually with my counsel,  lee wolosky, in the early s when we were both research  assistants\tat the kennedy school  at harvard working on technical assistance projects.  after i completed my ph.d. at harvard and finished  working with\t, i then worked for the  eurasia foundation.\ti was the director of strategic planning  for the eurasia foundation, which was a congressionally  funded technical assistance foundation.\ti became an adjunct  fellow at the brookings institution in , and i became a  fulltime employee of the brookings institution around , \t.  unclassified\t  i then, from the beginning of  through to \tnovember , at the end of the bush administration and the  first year of the obama administration, was the national  intelligence officer for russia and eurasia at the national  intelligence council.  i then returned to brookings in the end of \tnovember , and for the next  years, i was the director  of the center on the u.s. and europe at the brookings  institution before i joined the administration.  q\tyou mentioned that you were responsible for ii\toverseeing the interagency process as it relates to your  portfoli o.\tfocusing on ukraine, what does that mean?  a\tthat means bringing together interagency meetings,  state department, pentagon, every other department for  discussions of u.s. government policy.\tit also means  meeting, where appropriate, with ukrainian officials, meeting  with analysts from our intelligence services to get updates  on a regular basis on developments in ukraine, and also  preparing, of course, memoranda and any policy documents  necessary for the president or the national security advisor  or other senior members of staff who may be having  interactions pertinent to policy.  q\tall right.\twe are going to get into many of the  details during your time with the nsc, but i would like to  spend this first hour trying to hit on some topline issues     unclassified\t  and get an understanding more broadly about what was going on  wi th ukrain e while you were there.  and, i guess, the first question, and this is perhaps a  little di ff i cult, but can you describe, generally speaking,  what the offici al u.s. policy was related to ukraine and what  the focus of offi ci al u.s. poli cy was in relation to ukraine?  a\ti thi nk the policy towards ukraine was going  through a period of evoluti on in the time that i was in the  admi ni strat i on.\tmany of you, being longserv i ng members of io\tcongress, and the staff , will of course recall tha t, you i i\tknow, a lot of focus was put onto ukraine after the  annexation of crimea by russia in .  and then, of course, there was the outbreak of the war  in donbas, the downing of mh, and decisions made by  members of this body to impose sanctions on russia in  response to those acts that were conducted, those acts of  aggression against ukraine.  so, when i came into the administration there was a  great deal of debate.\tthis is, of course, you know, the  beginning of .\twe've had essentially plus years of  \tefforts to deter russia from taking further aggressive acts  against ukraine.\tthe war in donbas is still continuing.  there's a question about what role the united states  should play in the resolution of that conflict, because at  that juncture i t was the french and the germans in the course  unclassified\t  of the minsk group, the grouping set up by the french and the  germans, along with ukrainians and technically also the  russians, to try to find a resolution to the war in the  donbas.  the united states didn't actually have a role in this.  so we were in the process of deliberating then what role the  united states should play, how we would work together with  the french and the germans to try to seek a resolution of the  conflict in donbas, how we should conduct ourselves in terms io\tof assistance to ukraine; should there be the provision of ii lethal weaponry , meaning, of course, defensive weaponry; how  would we be able to help ukraine over the longer term  this  is a big debate with the pentagon  to rebuild its military  forces that had been decimated not just by the war with  russia but by the annexation of crimea because the russ i ans,  of course, seized the major ports and the whole entire  ukrainian black sea fleet, and, of course, it also devastated  their command and control.  we were also concerned about domestic politics in  ukraine.\ti mean, this has been a longstanding concern  through multiple admi ni strat i ons. and when i was in the dni,  i mean, i felt in many respects that i was reprieving, you  know, many of the analytical concerns that i'd had when i was  national intelligence officer for russia and ukraine.  we were worried about the stability of the ukra i ni an     unclassified\t  government, the role of oligarchs in the ukrainian  government.\tit was a very weak presidency.\tthere was, of  course, a great deal of corruption.\tthis has been standard  across most of the republics in the former soviet union in  their i ndependence .  many of them had had weak local governance in the soviet  structure.\tand when they became independent entities, they  weren't particularly well set up to be independent countries,  and there was a great deal of efforts by private interests  to, you know, pick away at the structures of government. ii\tthat happened in russia as well.  and we were also trying to figure out indeed how we  would work with our european allies on a much broader set of  projects related to ukraine's longterm sustai nab i li ty.\tso  it wasn't just tackling corruption or helping the ukrainians  build a more viable, sustainable state apparatus and  institutions, but also how we would tackle some key problems  for them beyond the restoration of their military capability,  including their dependency on russia for energy supplies as  well as acting as the main conduit or transit for energy  supplies from russia, exports of russian energy through  ukraine to the rest of europe.  so we were also starting to work on a more comprehensive  approach to russia's energy.\ti mean, you're all very much  familiar with the debates about nord stream .\ti was there  unclassified\t  in the bush administration for nord stream  when we were  also trying to block the expansion of pipelines from russia.  i mean, we tried again also under reagan in the soviet  peri od.\ti mean, this is a longstanding u.s. policy to find  ways of diversifying european energy supplies.  and so we were starting to look at how we could try to  wean ukraine off the dependence on russian energy and try to  find other energy suppliers, be it u.s. lng or other oi l and  gas supplies, coal, including from pennsylvania and, you  know, other u.s. states. ii\tso we were, you know, as i'm trying to point out here,  having a wideranging set of discussions about ukraine all  against the backdrop, obvi ously, of a debate about how  effect iv e the sanctions were being on russia's own behavior  and, you know, russ i a's own attitudes towards ukraine.  mr. wolosky:\tmr. goldman, can i just interject that the  witness is obviously testifying to u.s. deliberative  processes relating to the conduct of u.s. foreign policy.\ti  actually don't think that this is covered by the letter from  the white house counsel's office, but i would appreciate  guidance and a ruling from the chair on testimony such as the  type that she is offering.  the chairman:\ti thank the counsel for raising the  issue, and i'm prepared to rule on it now.  dr. hill, you are compelled to testify at this     unclassified\t  deposition by subpoena that was issued to you by the house  intelligence committee on october , .\tyour counsel has  raised a potential objection on behalf of the white house  stating that information that you are providing could be  covered by pri vi leg e.\tunder the house deposition rules, as  the chair, i have the authority to rule on that potential  objection.  as you know, only the president may assert executive  privilege, and he usually does so in writing with specificity  along with an opinion from the justice department.\tthe ii\tpresident and department of justice have not specifically  invoked executive privilege with respect to the in formati on  requested.  the president has also spoken extensively about the  matters under investigation here, and he has declassified and  publicly released a summary of his call with the ukrainian  president.\tthe administration also declassified the  whi stleblower complaint and a range of accompanying materials  that addressed the range of issues under discussion today.  the presi dent's actions have further opened the door to  further investigative actions and taking of testimony on  these subjects.\tthe president has waived his abi li ty to  block others from making statements about the same matt ers  that contradict his own statements or expose his wrongdoing.  the privilege cannot be used to conceal misconduct during   unclassified\t  in particular during an impeachment inquiry.  to the extent that the white house may be asserting a  deliberative process privilege as an element of executive  privilege, this is not a privilege recognized by the  congress.\tfurthermore, the information the witness has been  asked to provide is critical to the commi ttee's  i nvest i gati on.  we must obtain your answers here because congress has a  constitutional duty to expose wrongdoing in the executive and io\tact as a check and balance to the power of the executive,  especially when there is significant evidence that the  president is abusing his executive power for his own personal  gai n.\ttherefore, i am overruling any potential assertion of  privilege, and i instruct the witness to answer all questions  during the deposition today.  mr. zeldin:\tmr. chairman, respectfully , if the witness  is about to give an answer and is unsure of whether or not  her answer may violate a privilege, is the witness permitted  to consult with the executive branch for advice on that  question of whether or not that content is privileged?  the chairman:\tmr. zeldin, the white house had the  opport uni ty , in correspondence with the witness prior to the  testimony today , to raise any specific objection to any  specific questi on.\tthey chose not to do so.\tand, therefore,  we will go forward as the chair has ruled.     unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\tthat's not what the question  well,  respectfully, mr. chair, the question is, if the witness'  understanding of what is pri vileged\tcomes up and the witness  is unsure as to whether or not her answer is going to violate  something that's privileged, will the witness be permitted to  get advice before being forced to provide information that \tmay be privileged?  the chairman:\tno, counsel.\tthe counsel for the witness  has already been in communication with the white house, has  already received whatever guidance the white house was  willing to give.\tthe chair has made a ruli ng on the question  of privilege; none applies here.\twe will not be asking the  witness about extraneous conversations with the presi dent  about other matters.\tour focus today will be on ukraine, and  the chair has ruled.  mr. goldman.  mr. jordan:\tmr. chairman, if i could, just one quick  followup.\tso, if dr. hill gets a question and she beli eves  it does violate what she has communicated  the  communications her and her counsel have had with the  executive branch and she chooses not to answer that question,  are you then going to overrule it?  the chairman:\tmr. jordan, as the witness counsel has  already made clear, the wi tness' counsel has ra i sed the  concerns that were expressed to the witness through  unclassified\t  correspondence with the white house.\tit's appropriate that  the counsel do so, and they have done so, and i have ruled on  that potenti al objection.\tthat is the process that we will  use today.  mr. jordan:\ti would just underscore, mr . chairman   then we can get back to mr. goldman's question  i would  just underscore this is why executive  agency counsel  should be here.\tthi s is why  i have never  this is   now  i've never been in these kind of proceedings where jo\tagency counsel wasn't permitted to be present.\twe wouldn't ii\t\thave these concerns if they were here.  the chairman:\tactually, mr. j ordan , you were present at  a deposition conducted by chairman issa without the presence  of agency counsel, and you were perfectly copacetic with it  at that time, so your statement is not accurate.\tbut,  nonetheless, the chair has ruled and we will go forward.  mr. goldman.  by mr. goldman:  q\tdr. hill, ultimately toward  by the end of your  tenure at the nsc, had the united states agreed to provide  lethal military assistance to ukraine to withstand the  aggression from russia in the eastern area of ukraine?  a\tthat's correct.  q\tand what anticorruption efforts did the u.s.  promote within ukraine du ri ng the time that you were there?     unclassified\t  a\twell, the time that i was there has also spanned  what was a period in ukraine itself of a transition in its  own government.\ti mean, we'll all recall that ukraine has  gone through quite a period of upheaval.  the independence movements back in the s, s,  s, then in a period of turmoil and changes of government,  and then the events that were sparked off by ukra i ne's  decision to try to join the european union, at least to form  an association agreement with the european union, that io\tprecipitated russia's decision to annex crimea because of the ii\trevolt in ukraine that led to a change in government.  so there was a focus, as i said before, on trying to  find a way of getting the ukrainian government to stabilize  and sustainable.\tand we were also in the period in the last  year or so of preparation for ukrainian presidential  elections, which made it quite complicated in trying to work  with the incumbent government and all of their institutions  and then looking forward to what might be a change of  government in ukraine.  so what we were trying to do was work with the  i nsti tuti ons that were there already in place, from the  prosecutor's office to the ukrainian parliament, the rada, to  government officials who these sets of issues came into their  purview, and the main locus of that activity was through our  embassy in kyiv and also through the state department.  unclassified\t  q\tnow   a\ti should also point out, of course, that we have  posted to the embassy in ukraine, just as is the case in most  emba ssi es, representatives of all the u.s. government  departments and agenci es that would be i nvolved in these  kinds of issues, so from the doj, fbi, and many others.  q\tbut certainly eli minating\tcorruption in ukraine was  one of, i f the central, goals of u.s. foreign policy?  a\tthat's ri ght, as it has been with many other former  soviet states where the corrupt ion pervades through anythi ng  from the pol ice force to getting into schools, getting  medical treatment, you know, all different levels of the  public sector.  q\tare you\tam i li ar with the intelligence communi ty's  assessment of whether russia interfered in the  electi on?  a\ti am.  q\tand are you fami li ar with an indictment that the  special counsel robert mu eller fi led in connection to russian  interference in the  electi on?    a  q  yes, i am. do you have any reason to doubt either the facts    alleged in the indictment or the intelligence community's  assessment that russi a did i nte rfere in the  election?   a i do not.  q and do ycu have any reason to believe that ukraine     unclassified\t  did interfere in the  election?  a\ti do not.\twe're talking about the ukrainian  government here when you say ukraine, correct?  q\tyes.  a\tyes, i do not.  q\tokay.\ti'm going to switch gears for a minute,  dr. hill.\twhen did you first become aware of the interest in  ukraine of rudy giuliani?   a  sorry   it would have been sometime between july  i'm january  and march .\tand i first became  ii\taware of it partly through articles in the newspaper that i  see some of our members of congress readi ng, the hill, by  john solomon, and also because of mr. giuliani 's statements  on television.   q  part of your duties and responsibilities is to keep   track of matters in the public, right, and in the media  related to the areas that you were covering.\tis that  accurate?  a\tnot entirely.\ti mean, my job was to, you know,  keep track of what our foreign counterparts were doing.\ti  have to, you know, confess right upfront that it's i ncred i bly  difficult to keep up with what everybody else is doing as  well.  and i would often rely on members of our internal nsc  press corps, other colleagues, our directors, and other  unclassified\t  people to flag anything for me that they thought that i  should be paying attent i on to.\ti had every morning an intel  brief, and it didn't, you know, basically always pertain to  domestic related issues, of course.  but we do get as much, of course  i think most of you  who have served in government know this\tcompilations of  clippings that the white house sit room deems to be of  relevance or of interest.\tand some of those would be  forwarded onto us if they had subjectrelated interest.\tso  that was how i first became aware that there was some deeper ii\tinterest on the part of mr. giuliani.  q\tand what did you understand that interest to have  been when you initially learned about it?  a\tto be honest, i had a hard time figuring out quite  what it was about because there were references to george  soros; there were references to ; and then there were all  kinds of references to  when i first read the article in  the hi ll , whi ch i thin k was i n late march of , it was  referring to donotprosecute lists and statements from the  ukrainian prosecutor, mr. lutsenko, none of which i'd ever  heard of anything about before.  q\tand at this point, what was your impression of the  ukra i ni an prosecutor general yuriy lutsenko?  a\ti hadn' t really formed much of a personal opinion  of him, but certainly from the information that i had, not      unclassified\t  just from our embassy but from also colleagues at the state  department and others across the analytical community, there  were clearly some problems with this gentleman in the way  that he was conducting his work.  q\tand around this time, what did you understand the  relationship between rudy giuliani and the president of the  united states to be?  a\tbeyond the official role of mr. giuliani as the  private attorney, i had no other sense whatsoever of what his  role might be.  q\tokay.\tdid you ever meet or communicate with rudy  giuliani directly on matters relating to ukraine?  a\ti did not.\ti've never actually met him.  q\tnow, after you first learned about mr. giuliani 's  interest in march, what did you understand to be the  development of his interest in ukraine after march?  a\twell, he seemed to develop a very strong interest  in ukra i ne in that tim efram e.\tand i was trying, you know, to  the best of my limited ability, to figure out what that  interest might be.\tand i made a couple of i nqu i ri es to  people to ask what they knew about his activities, and i wi ll  be quite frank in saying that most of the people who i spoke  to thought it was related to personal business on hi s part.  q\tand who did you initially speak to about  mr. giuliani?  unclassified\t  a\ti asked several of my colleagues who were, you \tknow, familiar wi th his work in new york.\ti asked other \t   because some of the references were obviously to  energy related issues.\ti talked to some of my colleagues  across the nsc who work in our energy directorate.  and i tried to read as much as i possibly could in the  press to figure out what was going on because, at this poi nt,  it started to have an impact obvi ously on our own work  because of the constant references by people to his  statements, especially on fox news. i \tq\tcan you explain what impact it had on the official  u.s. policy and your role in making tha t?  a\tbecause mr. gi uli ani was asserting qu i te frequen tly  on television in public appearances that he had been given  some authority over matters related to ukraine, and i f that  was the case, we hadn ' t been i nformed about that.\tbut he was  making a lot of public statements and, you know, obviously  making a lot of assert i ons, including about our ambassador to  ukraine, masha yovanovitch.  q\tdid you try to determin e whether mr. giuliani was  accurate and he had been given any portfolio over ukraine?  a\ti asked my, you know, direct superior ambassador  bolton if he was aware of mr. giuliani being given some  direct taski ngs related to ukraine, and he was not aware of  this.     unclassifie d\t  q\tdid you speak to anyone else about this?  a\tpeople in the state department also.  q\tall right.\tand what was their response?  a\teveryone was completely unaware of any direct  official role that mr. giuliani had been given on the ukraine  account.\tand, at that particular juncture, no one that i had  been in contact with had actually spoken to him.  q\tand what particular juncture are you referring to?  a\tyou asked me about the early stages, so around  march, april of . i i\tq\tto your knowledge, was mr. giuliani ever a  government employee?  a\tnot that i know of, no.  q\tdo you know whether he held a security clearance?  a\ti don't know.  q\tnow, you said that, initially, you were led to  believe that his interest was based on his personal financial  interest.\tdid you come to understand that that interest of  his evolved over time?  a\tif we're talking at later stages, i mean, it  depends on how you want to go through this, you know,  chronologically or, you know, what i started to know before i  left.\thow would you like to approach thi s?  q\ti' m asking after march, april, up until you left,  just broadly speaking, what did you come to understand his  unclassified\t  interests to encompass?  a\twell, there was a peri od before the ousting of our  ambassador, and there was a period after this.\tso, in the  period up until the ouster  and i'm using this, i think,  very clearly, i think, for all of us who were working on the  ukraine account, the dismissal of ambassador yovan ovi tch was  a real turning point for us.  because all of the information that i had seen in the  press. be it on the hill, john solomon's arti cles, on  mr. giuliani's whirlwind, on fox news or the newspaper i i\tarticles i looked at, material that was  you know, i asked \t   to collect together and, you know,  information that i got from other colleagues who were  tracking thi s as well seemed to point towards a mixture of i \tsome business associates of mr. gi uli ani .\ti was told the  names of the two gentlemen who happen to have just been  i ndi cted.\ti had not previously come across them at all.  there was also an american businessman in flori da who  was associated with them whose name was also mentioned to me,  harry sargeant.\ti di dn' t find any further information out  about him.\ti mean, and my job was to track what was going on  with ukraine, not to start looking, you know, at what  domestic actors were about.  i just want to make it very clear that at no time did i  try to go beyond the confines of my job.\ti was just trying  unclassified\t  to understand what was going on so that i could then factor  that in into any interactions that we were having with  ukrainian officials and across the board across the  interagency.  i was told that these gentlemen, mr. parnas, mr. fruman,  and mr. sargeant had all been in business with mr. giuliani,  and that the impression that a number of ukrainian officials  and others had had was that they were interested in seeking  business deals in ukraine.  q\tnow why did the removal of ambassador yovanovitch  mark a turning point for you?  a\tbecause there was no basis for her removal.\tthe  accusations against her had no merit whatsoever.\tthis was a  mishmash of conspiracy theories that, again, i've told you. i  believe firmly to be baseless, an idea of an association  between her and george soros.  i had had accusations similar to this being made against  me as well.\tmy entire first year of my tenure at the  national security council was filled with hateful calls,  conspiracy theories, which has started again. frankly, as  it's been announced that i've been giving this deposition,  accusing me of being a soros mole in the white house, of  colluding with all kinds of enemies of the president, and,  you know, of various improprieties.  and it seems to be extraordinarily easy, as ambassador      unclassified\t  yovanovitch pointed out in her opening testimony, for people  to make baseless claims about people and then to seek their  dismissal.  so i'd experienced exactly the same treatment that she  had in the whole first year of my tenure at the national  security council, which is a period in which lieutenant  general mcmaster and many other members of staff were  targeted as well, and many people were hounded out of the  national security council because they became frightened  about their own security.  \ti received, i just have to tell you, death threats,  calls at my home.\tmy neighbors reported somebody coming and  hammering on my door.\tmy\tpicked up a phone call  to have someone call me obscenities to •\t. \tvery  nervous about me testifying today as a result of that.  now, i'm not easily intimidated, but that made me mad.  and when i saw this happening to ambassador yovanovitch  again, i was furious, because this is, again, just this  whipping up of what is frankly an anti semi ti c conspiracy  theory about george soros to basically target nonpartisan  career officials, and also some political appointees as well,  because i just want to say this:\tthis is not in di scri mi nate  in its attacks.  and so it was obvious to us, and i mean all of my team,  everybody at the state department that i spoke to including      unclassified\t  at the higher levels, inside the nsc at the high levels as  well, that she'd been subject to a pretty ruthless, nasty  defamation to basically remove her from place.  and the most obvious explanation at that point, it has  to be said, seemed to be business dealings of individuals who  wanted to improve their investment positions inside of  ukraine itself, and also to deflect away from the findings of  not just the mueller report on russian interference but  what's also been confirmed by your own senate report, and  what i know myself to be true as a former intelligence  analyst and somebody who has been working on russia for more  than  years.\tso the fact that ambassador yovanovitch was  removed as a result of this was, i have to say, pretty  dispiriting.  q\twho did you understand was responsi ble for her  removal?  a\ti understood this to be the result of the campaign  that mr. giuliani had set in motion in conjunction with  people who were wri ti ng articles and, you know, publications  that i would have expected better of, and also, you know,  just the constant d rumb eat of these accusations that he was  making on the televi si on.  and as a result of that, he had created an atmosphere in  which she was under great suspicion, and it was obvious that  she would lose the confidence of senior people because these  unclassified\t  accusations seem to stick to people even when they're proved  not to be tru e.  q\twell, did you understand that the state  department   well, let me take a step back.\twho ultimately  made the decision to remove her?  a\ti assumed, and i was told, that it was at the top  levels of the state department because they felt that her  position was no longer tenable.  q\tdid you understand whether the presi dent of the  united states had a role in this at all? i i\ta\ti was not led to believe that.\ti did not hear  that , and i was not told that.\tbut i t was clear that her  position had become untenable by the nature of these  accusations against her.\tand there are many other  distinguished public servants who we read about in the paper  every single day who have resigned or get pushed out because  accusations are made against them that make it i ncred i bly  difficult for them to do their jobs.  q\twere you aware, by the end of april when ambassador  yovanovi tch was removed, that the president himself had  retweeted some of john solomon's articles in the hill related  to this?  a\ti think i had seen those tweets.\ti'd obviously  seen those tweets.  q\tand since you were working in the white house, what  unclass ified\t  di d you understand at that point, in april, the president's  view of ambassador yovanovitch to be, if you knew?  a\tbasically  yeah.  mr. wolosky:\tlet me just caution you not to speculate  about things that you don't know.  dr. hill:\tyeah.\ti was just going to say that i could  only form a judgment as everybody else could from the tweets.  i was not able to form any other judgment.\ti did not hear at  any juncture the president say anything about ambassador  yovanovitch.  by mr. goldman:  q\tand did you discuss ambassador yovanovitch with  ambassador bolton?  a\ti did.  q\tand what was his reaction to this?  a\this reaction was pained.\tand he basically said   in fact, he directly said:\trudy giuliani is a hand grenade  that is going to blow everybody up.  he made it clear that he didn't feel that there was  anything that he could personally do about this.  i met with ambassador yovanovitch and assistant  secretary phil reeker on may st when she was recalled to  washington, d.c., to hear from her and to hear from acting  assistant secretary phil reeker what they thought had  happened.  unclassified\t  because this had a really devastating eff€ct on the  morale of all of the teams that i work wjth across the  interagency because everybody knows ambassador yovanovitch to  be the best of the best in terms of a nonpartisan career  official.  and as a woman, and, you know, i don't see always a lot  of promi nent women in these positions, she was the highest  ranking woman di plomat.\tand i have worked with her across  all of my career in  both i n government when i was at the  dni and also in the think tank world as a professional who  works on this region when she'd been ambassador in armenia  and also in kyrgyzstan.  and i only have a professional rela ti onshi p with her.\ti '  don't see myself as a personal friend of hers.\tbut i just  see her as epitomizing what united states diplomacy should  be.  q\tduring that meeti ng that you had on may st, did  she relay to you what the reasoning for her removal was as  she understood i t?  a\tshe relayed to me basi cally the same things that  she wrote in her testimony, and that has been made publi c.  and she was deeply disappointed and very upset.\tshe also  made it clear tha t she wasn't going to grandstand and that  she appreci ated that the state deprtment were trying to help  her.      unclassified\t  it was obvious that this had left a lot of her  colleagues at high levels feeling extremely upset.\tit  certainly seemed that deputy sullivan, assistant secretary  reeker, and other officials in the state department's highest  levels were trying to do their best to make sure that she,  you know, kept her reputation and was also given at least a  position in the interim that would be worthy of the kind of  person that she i s.\tshe's, remember, also been commandant of  the national defense university.\ti mean, this is really one  of our most distinguished diplomats. ii q\tdid she indicate to you that deputy secretary  sullivan had told her that this order had come from the  president at that point?  a\tshe did not say that to me, but she did say that he  had said to her that there was no cause for her dismissal and  that he was deeply regretful of it.\tshe was being very  discreet.  q\tand it was your understanding that no one at the  senior levels at the state department had any issues with her  qualifications or her competence?  a\tthat was my understanding, and the same with all of  her colleagues across the diplomatic corps, the ambassadorial  corps, and certainly within the national security council.  q\tand did you understand whether secretary pompeo had  any concerns about her work product or competency?  unclassified\t  a\ti neve r heard anything to in di cate that.                  i i                            unclassified\t    by mr. goldman:  q\tand you said a second ago or a few minutes ago that  you never heard anything directly from the president related  to  a\ti did not.  q\t ambassador yovanovitch.  just broadly speaking, we're not going to get ri ght now  into the communications, but how frequently did you speak to  the president about any matters under your portfolio? ii a\tonly in the context of la rger meetings,  particularly around visits.\tit changed over time.\tin the  first year of our  of the presidency under general  mcma ster, he had a very different style, and he would bring  many of us into meetings.  that was different under ambassador bolton, but i think  that that's also quite typ i cal of the approach of different  na ti onal security advisors, so i don't read anything into  that.\tpeople have a different approach.\tand, as you know,  there's been a big debate since the beginning of the na ti onal  security council when it was first set up, you know, around  the time of, you know, world war ii and the cold war, about  what the right size, what the composition should be, and what  the approach should be, both of the national security advisor  and the staff.  unclassified\t  q\tnow, so as it relates directly to ukraine, how many  conversations did you have with  were you present for where  the president was discussing ukraine, ukrainian policy, or  otherwise?  mr. wolosky:\ti think i t's fine to answer the question  of how many, generally speaking, times you were in  discussions with the president.\ti mean, if there are further  questions about the content of those discussions    mr. goldman:\ti'm asking because she indicated that she j o\tdi dn't hear anything about ambassador yovanovitch directly ii\tfrom the president, so i'm trying just to understand how  frequen tly she would have been in a position to discuss these  matters.  dr. hill:\ti mean, just also to be clear, ukraine was  not a top policy item in a lot of this period.\tand my  portfolio covered all of europe.\tit covered turkey, which,  you know, obviously, there was a great deal of activity, and  russia.  so it was really only ever in the context of when there  would be an official meeting with the ukrainian president.  and in the time that i was there, there were not a great deal  of meetings with the ukrainian leadership.\tthere was  poroshenko at one of the u.n. general ·assembli es.  so the meetings were only very much in the context of  brief preparatory discussions for a meeting  and this is      unclassified\t  obviously covered by executive privilege  with heads of  state.  mr. goldman:\tso you said that ambassador yovanovitch's  removal was a turning poi nt.\thow di d things change after  that?  the chairman:\tbefore we go to that, if i could just  ask, dr. hill, you mentioned that the decision to remove the  ambassador, as far as you knew, took place at the top of the  state department.\tby that, do you mean secretary pompeo or  someone else?  dr. hill:\tthis would be a presumption so   mr. wolosky:\tif you don't know the answer, don't  speculate.\tjust state what you know.  the chairman:\tambassador yovanovitch rela ted seeking  support, a statement of support from the secretary of state.  that was not forthcom i ng.\tdo you have any personal knowledge  of those circumstances?  dr. hill:\ti do not.\ti did take part in basically  revi ewin g statements of support for ambassador yovanovi tch  from the state department, but this was done at the working  \tlevel.\ti mean, there were many announcements trying to  refute some of basically the baseless accusations against  ambassador yovanovitch i n the period of march and april.  and i just want to say again that i met with her on may  st, when she had been unexpectedly summoned back to  unclassified\t  washington, d.c.\tit took all of us by surprise because, to  be frank, i thought that those accusations about her would be  dismissed because they were clearly, in some cases, just  absurd.  by mr. goldman:  q\tso just going back to after her removal, how did   you said it was a turning point.\thow so?  a\twell, it was a shock, to be frank , to all of the  team.\tambassador yovanovitch had been a key person, as i jo\tmentioned before.\tmany of the interagencyapproved policies ji\tthat we were implementing were carried out primarily by the  embassy in kyiv, and we had just then lost the leadership.  ther e was also a changeover in the embassy at that  point, as the  inevitably, as you get into the  springsummer period, as new staff are going to be brought on  board at the embassy.\tand so there was a bit of a kind of a  loss of direction for a period.  now, we had, of course, the ongoing efforts of  ambassador kurt volker as the u.s. envoy for ukraine.\tbut at  this particular juncture, ambassador volker's main job had  been to meet with the russians as well as the other members  of the normandy format minsk group, the french and the  germans, under the european leadership.  but the russians at this particular juncture were not  really picking up on the idea of having further meetings.  unclassified\t  they were stonewalling because they themselves didn't want to  make very clearly any steps in determining the future of  their own ukraine policy until they found out who they were  going to be dealing with in the ukrainian presidential  election.  now, we'd had, of course, the election in april of  zelensky, but at this point, we were also waiting to see what  would happen in the ukrainian parliamentary elections, the  rada, to see whether zelensky would be able to have a  workable majority.  you might also recall in november of , there was the  incident in the kerch strait, where the russians sei zed naval  vessels of the ukrainian navy that were trying to enter  through international waters of the kerch strait into the sea  of azov and then detained their sailors after, in fact,  firing on the two ukrainian ships and injuring at least one,  but maybe more of the sai lors.\tand they'd taken the sailors  to moscow.\tthey were effectively becoming prisoners of war.  and we'd been focused in this period on trying to push  the russians to release the ukrainian sailors, and we had  pulled down meetings, bilateral meetings with president  putin\tthis was actually the president's decision to do  so  in response to the russi ans' refusal to release the  ukrainians.  and so, you know, there were many issues that we were  unclassified\t  sti ll trying to push at this peri od, and we had to fi gure out  how we were going to do thi s.\tso there was a period of  unce rt ai nty as to how we were going to be conducti ng our  ukrain e pol i cy.  q\tand that's from the official united states  posi ti on, you mean?  a\tcorrect.  q\tnow, how did rudy gi uli ani 's efforts from after    from may through the summer impact the official u.s. foreign  policy?  a\twell, we heard that he was planning on vi si ti ng  ukraine, and we didn't know why, you know, for what purpose  and what was his i ntent.\tand, you know, i heard about that  on the news and read about that in the paper.\ti mean ,  subsequently that meeting was pulled down.  but thi s was then in the period where ambassador volker  told us tha t he was planning on meeting wi th mr. gi uli an i to  try to see if he could resolve whatever issues there may be  there.\tyou've had ambassador volker come and talk on his own  terms and to answer your questions, and i'm sure he's told  you what he told us.  but this is also in the period where, rather  unexpectedly, our ambassador to the eu, ambassador sandland  informed us, but just i nform ed us without, again, us bei ng  gi ven any specific directive, that he had been assigned to be      unclassified\t in charge, at least in interim fashion, of the ukraine \tportfoli o.   q and around when was that?  a that was in the mayjune timeframe.  q and who did you understand assigned ambassador  sandland to do that?  a at first, nobody.\tand it was only later, very late  june, when ambassador sandland told me again that he was in  charge of ukraine.\tand i asked, well, on whose authority?  and he said, the presiden t.  q\tat this point now, mr. giuliani had indicated he  was going to speak to ukrainian officials, and then he  decided not to go.\tnow, into the june tim efram e into july,  did you understand what he was advocating about  in ukraine  and what his interests were?  a\tin this period in may, i had a request from a  former u.s. government official to meet with me.\tthi s was  amos hochstein, the former u.s. envoy for energy , who i'd  previously worked with in different capacities.  mr. hochstein had been appointed to the board of naftogaz,  the main ukra i ni anu.s  gas and oil company.\the had  actually been appointed during this administration, in  conjunction with discussions with the department of energy.  so i just want to make clear that although amos  hochstein had been the u.s. energy envoy under president   unclassified      obama. he was somebody who was wellrespected by department of ene rgy, and he had very close ties the with   secretary perry's staff and also with people who served on    the na ti onal security counci l who worked on energy issues.  so they were very comfortable with him taking on this role.  and he'd been in the position for several months,  perhaps even a year at this juncture when he came in to talk  with me, which was towards the end of may.\tand he came in to  express some serious concerns that he had.\tin the course of  his time on the board of naftogaz, which he actually said had ii\tactually not been a particularly uplifting experience, it had  come to his attention that there was a lot of pressure being  put on the officials of naftogaz, who had also reached out to  talk to me and my colleagues at the national security  council, to have other board members put in place and this  seemed to be at the direction of giuliani. and that they were  also being pushed more generally in the ukrainian energy  sector to open up investigations into corruption in the  energy sector that seemed to go beyond what i had assumed was  the thrust of our push on corruption, which was related to  people trying to siphon off assets of naftogaz or to use that  improperly, which had been done at many times in the past,  and, in fact, would include the energy company burisma that  everyone has been very concerned about.  i, to be honest, had forgotten the name of burisma.\tit      unclassified\t  had been a long time since that name had surfaced.\tit had  been on my radar screen sometime previously, and i asked amos  to remind me of the burisma issue.\tand he reminded me that  this was the company that hunter biden had been affiliated  with.  so, at that juncture, it became clear, from amos'  concerns that he was flagging for me   he also said that a  number of ukrainian officials had come to him very concerned  that they were getting pressure from giuliani and giuliani   associates  and fruman  and he also mentioned the names of mr. parnas to basically start to open up investigations   and also to change the composition of the naftogaz board.  q\tso did you come to understand that mr. giuliani  perhaps, at a minimum, was advocating for an investigation  into burisma?  a\tit was part of what seemed to be a package of  issues that he was pushing for, including what seemed to be  the business interests of his own associates.  q\tand when  the way mr. hochstein explained it to  you, did you understand what rudy giuliani 's interest in an  investigation into burisma was?  a\tnot entirely, i did not at that juncture.  q\tat a later point, did you come to understand what   i t was?  a\tonly, frankly, since i' ve left the administration.  unclassified\t   q\tand what is that?  a\tit's only based on  been reading in the papers.       and, again, this is what i've my jaw dropped when i saw the   indictments of these two gentlemen, of fruman and parnas.\tso  it becomes clear that they were certainly up to no good.\tbut  that was what i was already hearing.  and i was also told by amos and other colleagues that  they had some linkages, so i also want to, you know, get you  to step back at this period.\tthis is, you know, march,  april, into may, where we were having a standoff over ii\tvenezuela.\tand the russians at this particular juncture were  signaling very strongly that they wanted to someho make some  very strange swap arrangement between venezuela and ukraine.  in other words , if we were going to exert some semblance  of the monroe doctrine of, you know, russia keeping out of  our backyard, because this is after the russians had sent in  these hundred operatives essentially to, you know, basically  secure the venezuelan government and, you know, to preempt  what they were obviously taking to be some kind of u.s.  military acti on, they were basically signaling:\tyou know,  you have your monroe doctrine.\tyou want us out of your  backyard.\twell, you know, we have our own version of this.  you're in our backyard in ukraine.\tand we were ge:ting that  sent to us, you know, kind of informally through channels.  it was in the russian press, various commentators.     unclassified\t  and i was asked to go out to russia in this timeframe to  basically tell the russians to knock this off.\ti was given a  special assignment by the national security council with the  agreement with the state department to get the russians to  back off.  so, in the course of my discussions with my colleagues \t, i also found out that there  were ukrainian energy interests that had been in the mix in  venezuelan energy sectors as well as the names again of  mr. parnas and mr. fruman, and this gentleman harry sargeant  came up.\tand my colleagues   said these guys were notorious in florida and that they were  bad news.  q\tand you understood that they were working with rudy  giuliani at that point?  a\ti did at this point.  q\tyou mentioned ambassador sandland, who i think in \tjune told you that he had been assigned by the president to  cover ukraine.\tyou said that was somewhat of an unusual  development.\twhat did you mean by that?  a\twell, it was very unusual because we were given no  instructions.\tthere wasn' t a directive.\tambassador bolton  didn't know about this.\tnobody at the state department  seemed to know about this either.\ti went to consult several  times with senior state department officials to ask them if  unclassified\t  they knew if this was the case.  q\tand what did they say?  a\tthey said they had no  no directive, no  information to suggest this.  q\tand who did you speak to about this?  a\ti spoke to under secretary hale.\ti spoke to  assistant secretary reeker.\tand i did have a phone call at  one point with ulrich brechbuhl, the counsel to secretary  pompeo.  but i also have to say that ambassador sondland had  asserted  and, again, i mean asserted by telling me that he  had a very large remit for his understanding of ambassador to  the european union.\the referred to a letter outlining his  authorities and his responsibilities given to him by the  state department, which is, frankly, the regular state  department letter to ambassadors when they, you know,  get remit as the plenipotentiaries and the representatives of  the president.  in all cases, you know, they have quite extensive  responsibilities and authorities anyway.\tbut said that he  had been  again, this is what he said to us, and i can only  tell you what ambassador sondla nd said to me, that the  president had given him broad authority on all things related  to europe, that he was the president's point man on europe.  so this meant that anything that was related to the     unclassified\t  european union could, in his vi ew, fall within his purview.  and i was constantly going back to state department and to  the deputy assistant secretaries and acting assistant  secretary to try to clarify this.\tand, again, in each case,  they had no knowledge of these responsi bi li ti es that had been  accorded to ambassador sondland in his rendi ti on of these  issues.  and so i was spending an inordinate amount of time  trying to coordinate in some fashion with ambassador sondland io\ton a whole range of issues rela ted to visits by heads of ii\tstates, meetings.\tand ambassador sondland would frequently  give people my personal cell phone to call up and demand  meetings with ambassador bolton or with me.  we had all kinds of officials from europe, particularly  when \twas the president in office of the european  un i on, li tera lly appearing at the gates of the white house,  calling on our personal phones, which are actually in lock  boxes, so it was kind of difficult to get hold of them.\ti'd  find endless messages from irate \tofficials who'd  been told that they were supposed to meet with me by  ambassador sondland.  i mean, some of it was comical, but it was also, for me  and for others, deeply concerning.\tand i actually went to  our intelligence bureau and asked to have   \tsit down with him and explain that this was a  unclassified\t  counterintelligence risk, particularly giving out our  personal phone numbers.\tand also just, i mean, basically  going beyond the larger remit because he should have been  having briefings.\tif\t, indeed, he had been given these  assignments, he should have been having appropriate briefings  for all of these meeti ngs.  and as far as i could understand, the briefings that he  was getting  so he was often meeting with people he had no  i nformat i on about.\tit's like basically driving along with no  guardrails and no gps on an unfamiliar terr i tory.\the was ii\tmeeting with, for example, \tofficials that we had  derogatory information on that he shouldn 't have been meeting  with, or he was, you know, giving out his phone number and  texting to, you know, reg i onal officials, for example, the  prime minister of \twho he met at a meeting in  brussels.\tall of those communications could have been  exfi ltrated by the russians very easily.  so i' ll just say right upfront we had a lot of concerns,   but i expressed these openly to ambassador sondland. so i'm  not telling you anything that i di dn 't say to him.   q\tdid there come a time when you had a meeting at the  white house with ukrainian officials in early ju ly, where  ambassador sondland was also present?   a  q  yes, that is correct. do you recall what day that was?     unclassified\t a\tthat was july th.\tso this was essentially the  week before i was due to wrap up and hand off.  q\tand who was present for that meeting?  a\tthis was a meeting by, at this point, the appointee  for president zelensky to be his nat i onal security advisor,  oleksandr danylyuk, and his personal adviser, a gentleman who  has been named in the press, andrey yermak, with ambassador  bolton.\tsecretary perry was also in attendance.\tyermak had  an assistant.\tambassador sondland.\tthere was our ukraine  director, ambassador volker, and myself and our senior ii\tdirector for energy affairs, wells griffith.  and there may have also been  the room got a bit  crowded and, i had to sit on the back sofa.\ti think there  might have also been one of secretary perr y's aides with him  in that meeting.\tand then there were other officials who  were also there in attendance, but not in ambassador bolton's  office, who were waiting out in one of the anterooms.  q\tand what was the ostensible purpose of the meeting?  a\tit was twofold.\tdanylyuk, who was the designated  national security advisor, was trying to seek assistance in  what he wanted to do with a revamp of the ukrainian national  security council, which, frankly, could do with it.\tand so  he was wanting to ask ambassador bolton for his assistance  and recommendations on, you know, what they could do to sort  of streamline the national security apparatus, and would the  unclassified\t  u.s. be willing to help with technical assistance.\ti mean,  again, this would be something that would normally be done  through the state department.\tit's not something that the  national security council deals with.\tbut i think they were  trying to get ambassador bolton's imprimatur, because he is  the national security advisor, and support for this.  and also ambassador bolton has, you know, deep knowledge  of many issues, and mr. danylyuk was hoping to get, you know,  some of his advice just in the general perspective of  national security issues.  and then there was also that the ukrainians were very  anxious to set up a meeting, a first meeti ng between  president zelensky and our president.  q\tand there had already been a writteq invitation to  that effect by that point from the white house, right?  a\tit wasn't an invitation.\tit was basically a  general, you know, we look forward to seeing you kind of  openended invitation at the end of a congratulatory letter  that was sent to president zelensky after his election in  apr i l.  q\tbut you unders tood that the ukrainians wanted   president zelensky to make a white house visit?  a correct.  q why is that?  a every single leader, with very few exceptions,      unclassified\t  who's either come into office or been in office some period  wants to have a meeting with the president at the white  house.\tall of my interactions with ambassadors or officials  from other countries inevitably came to, when can we have a  white house meeting, and if we can't meet with the president,  when can we meet with the vice president?  and people, you know, in these circumstances were not  satisfied with perhaps a pullaside at a la rger event like  the g or the u.n. ga.\tthey wanted to have a white house  meeting, if at all possible.  q\tdid anything happen in that meeting that was out of  the ordinary?  a\tyes.\tat one point during that meeting, ambassador  bolton was, you know, basically tryin g very hard not to  commit to a meeting, because, you know  and, again, these  meeti ngs have to be wellprepared.\tthey're not just  something that you say, yes, we're going to have a meeting  without there being a clear understanding of what the content  of that meeting is going to be.  and that is a perpetual problem for us, that many  not  all leaders but some, you know, want to really just have a  photo opportunity often for their own purposes.\ti mean,  legitimacy and legitimization of them as a new leader is  obviously very important.\tthat's not just an inconsequential  issue.  unclassified\t  but sometimes  you know, the previous president  poroshenko very much wanted a white house meeting in the  runup to his election, because he wanted to use that for his  election campaign.\twe've had, you know, all kinds of leaders  or people who are running for reelection actually try to  ambush the president.  we had one candidate for election in one country that i  won't state who showed up at the \tstate fair and worked  the rope li ne to get a picture with the president and then  put it up on the website of his campaign, claiming that he'd  had a personal meeting with the presi dent.\twell, you know,  it was against a backdrop, so you couldn't see the cows in  the background or, you know, the farm entity, but we all  thought it was quite hysterical that they go to those lengths  to work the rope line \tto get a picture.  but this shows the i mportance that leaders put on  meeting with our president, and having a white house meeti ng  is obviously the most important of all.\tand ambassador  bolton is always  was always very cautious and always very  much, you know, by the book and was not going to certainly  commit to a meeting right there and then, certainly not one  where it wasn't  it was unclear what the content of the  meeting would be about, what kind of issues that we would  discuss that would be pertaining to ukrainianu.s. relations.  and secretary perry had been talking in this context      unclassified\t  about the importance of reforming the energy structures in  ukraine in a very general sense and talking about how  important that was for ukrainian national security and that,  as well as reforming their national security structures, they  also have to, you know, really pay attention to their  achilles heel, all the places that russia had leverage, the  military sector, which ambassador bolton had also been  talking about, and then the energy sector, which was really  in some considerable di sarray.  then ambassador sondland blurted out:\twell, we have an ii\tagreement with the chief of staff for a meeting if these  investigations in the energy sector start.  and ambassador bolton immediately stiffened.\the said  words to the effect  i can't say word for word what he said  because i was behind them sitting on the sofa with our senior  director of energy, and we all kind of looked up and thought  that was somewhat d.\tand ambassador bolton immediately  stiffened and ended the meeting.  q\tright then, he just ended the meeting?  a\tyeah.\the said:\twell, it was very nice to see you.  you know, i can't discuss a meeting at this time.\twe'll  clearly work on this.\tand, you know, kind of it was really  nice to see you.  so it was very abrupt.\ti mean, he looked at the clock  as if he had, you know, suddenly another meeting and his time  unclassified\t  was up. but it was obvious he ended the meeting.  q\tand did you have a conversation with ambassador  bolton after this meeting?  a\ti    did.  q\tdescribe that.  a\tambassador sandland said as he was leaving   again, i was back  to the back of ambassador bolton's  office.\tand ambassador sandland said to ambassador volker  and also secretary perry and the other people who were with  him, i nclud in g the ukrainians. to come down to   there's a  room in the white house, the ward room, to basically talk  about next steps.\tand that's also unusual.\ti mean, he meant  to talk to the ukrainians about next steps about the meeting.  and ambassador   q  a  the white house meeting? the white house meeting.\tand ambassador bolton   pulled me back as i was walking out afterwards and said:\tgo  down to the ward room right now and find out what they' re  talking about and come back and talk to me.  so i did go down.\tand i came in as there was obviously  a discussion underway.\tand there was a very large group of  people in the room.\tthey were the aides to the ukrainian  officials, mr. yermak and mr. danylyuk.\tthere were a couple,  at least two state department aides who had come over with  ambassador sandland.\tthere was ambassador volker's aide, and  unclassified\t  there were a couple of other people.\ti weren't sure who they  were, whether they'd been part of secretary perry's team.  but as i was coming in, secretary perry was leavi ng to go off  to another engagement.\tso i think that one person there was  probably one of his team, but i'm not sure for certain,  because i di dn't recognize the person.\tand there was also  our director for ukrainian affairs.  and ambassador sondland, in front of the ukrainians, as  i came in, was talki ng about how he had an agreement with  chief of staff mulvaney for a meeting with the ukrainians if ii\tthey were going to go forward with investigations.\tand my  director for ukraine was looking completely alarmed.\tand i  came in again as this discussion was underway.\tmr. danylyuk  looked very alarmed as well.\the di dn't look like he knew  what was going on.\tthat wasn't the case with yermak.  and i immediately said to ambassador sondland:\tlook, we  can' t discuss the meeting here with our ukrainian colleagues.  ambassador bolton sent me down to ask  you know, kind of to  make sure that you understand that we'll be talking about the  meeting.\twe'll obviously be looki ng into this, but that we  can't make any commitments at this particular juncture  because a lot of things will have to be worked through in  terms of the timing and the substance .  and ambassador sondland cut me off, and he said:\twe  have an agreement that they'll have a meeting.  unclassified\t  and i said:\tlook, we cannot discuss this in front of  our colleagues.\tyou know, we have to talk about, you know,  the details of this.  and he said:\tokay, okay, i get it.  and he asked the ukrainians to basically leave the room.  so they basically moved out into the corri dor.  and i said:\tlook, i don't know what's going on here,  but ambassador bolton wants to make it very clear that we  have to talk about, you know, how are we going to set up this  meeting.\tit has to go through proper procedures. ii\tand he started to basically talk about discussions that  he had had with the chief of staff.\the mentioned mr.  giuliani, but then i cut him off because i d i dn't want to get  further into this discussion at all.  and i said:\tlook, we're the national security council.  we're basically here to talk about how we set this up, and  we're going to set this up in the right way.\tand, you know,  ambassador bolton has asked me to make it completely clear  that we're going to talk about this, and, you know, we will  deal with this in the proper procedures.\tand ambassador  sandland was clearl y annoyed with this, but then, you know,  he moved off.\the said he had other meetings.  and i went back to talk to ambassador bolton.\tand  ambassador bolton asked me to go over and report this to our  nsc counsel, to john eisenberg.\tand he told me, and this is      unclassified\t  a direct quote from ambassador bolton:\tyou go and tell  eisenberg that i am not part of whatever drug deal sondland  and mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him  what you' ve heard and what i've said.\tso i went over to talk  to john eisenberg about this.  mr. goldman:\twe'll have to pick that up in the next  round.\tour time is up.\tover to the minority.  the chairman:\tthe minority is recognized.  by mr. castor:  q\tgood morning, dr. hill, steve castor with the ii\trepublican staff.  a\tyes.  q\tambassador volker related his thoughts about the \tjuly th white house meeting.\twas secretary perry involved  with that, was he in the meeting?  a\the wasn't in the ward room when i came in.\the was  leaving out.\tbut he was in the meeting with ambassador  bolton, correct.  q\tthe first part of the meeting?  a\tthat is correct, yes.  q\tcould you just run down the people that were in the  meeting again?\tdanylyuk, yermak.  a\tyeah, yermak's assistant or ai de, whose name, i'm  sorry, i don' t recall.\tthere was wells griffith, p. wells  gri ffi th, our senior dir ector for energy.\the and i were  un class i f i ed\t  sitting together on the sofa.\tthere was secretary perry.  there was our director for ukraine, and there was ambassador  volker and alex vindman, and there was ambassador bolton.  and, again, there may have been another aide to    q\twas volker there?  a\tvolker was there.\tyes, correct, he was there.  there may have been another aide to secretary perry.\ti'm  just trying to think about the layout across the table.    and   it's   not a very big table.\tbecause i think there was somebody  else sitting in one of the chairs.\tand i'm afraid, i'm ii\tsorry, i can't recall who it was.  q\tdid i get this right?\tyou said bolton wanted you  to go down to john eisenberg, and he said, i'm not part of  any drug deal?  a\tthat's exactly what he said, quote/unquote.\ti  think he was being ironic.\tbut he wasn't very happy.\the was  very angry.   q   a  then you went down and spoke with eisenberg? yes, i went across to speak to him in the other   building.  q\tand what did you tell eisenberg?  a\ti told ambassador eisenberg that ambassador bolton  had instructed me to go over there right away.\tand i gave  him the details of what had transpired in the meeting in  ambassador bolton's office and then what i had overheard as i      unclassified\t  came into the ward room and that my, you know, kind of  primary concern for me personally was the fact that  ambassador sondland was saying all of this in front of  foreign nationals.  now, the ward room is located right beside the navy  mess.\tit's inside really the secure spaces of the white  house.\tambassador sondland said he had requested this room  through the chief of staff's office, because i was a bit  surprised that they had this room.\twe do meet with fo rei gn  delegations in there, but usually in a formal setting, not ii\tjust for informal talks.  and when he pushed them also out of that, they were  basically standing in a space between the navy mess and the  white house sit room.\tso this was an awkward setup, to say  the least.\tso i also expressed those concerns to john, that  then foreign nationals, you know, are just standing around in  the corridor outside the ward ro?m by the doors into the sit  room.  q\tthe president sent a letter may th, are you  familiar wi th that, where he congratulated zelensky?  a\ti am familiar with that, right.  q\tand at the end of the letter  we can make it an  exhibit if we need to, but the president says:\ti would like  to invite you to meet with me at the white house in  washington, d.c., as soon as we can find a mutually  unclassified\t convenient time.  a\tcorrect.  q\tyou're aware of that?  a\tyes.\tand i also want to tell you that ambassador  sondland told us that he had dictated that paragraph to the  president and to the chief of staff to add to that letter.  that letter did not go through the normal nsc procedures  because the initial draf t of the letter that we had put in  place was sent back to the chief of staff.\tso ambassador  sondland coordinated on that letter directly with the chi ef  of staff, and it did not go back through the national  security council exec sec.\ti had to get that letter directly  from the whi te house exec sec.  q\tis this an unusua l statement to put in a letter?  a\tnot at all.\ti mean, it's the kind of thing that  one would normally have in  or might have in a letter , but  i have to say, again , we were very cautious because i t's not  the case that you want actually every single head of state  who's just been elected to come to the white house.\tso we  would usually have somethin g more generic, we look forward  to seeing you, you know, kind of at some future event,  because a lot of heads of state we'd much prefer to meet with  them on the margins of the u.n. general assembly or nato or,  you know, some other event because, i mean, you can't have  basically every week the president having to host some head      unclassified\t  of state in the white house.  q\tis it fair to say sometimes these invitations are  theoretically extended, but, in practicality, they don't come  to fruition?  a\tthat is corr ect.\tthey're often done as a courtesy,  you know, as one  and the president has had invitations  like that himself.\tyou may remember he got an i nvi tati on  from theresa may on her first visit to the white house in   for a state visit to the united kingdom, and that took a  long time to come about. ii\tq\tso is it fair to say it's part of the diplomatic  pleasantries?  a\tthat is correct.  q\tsay, we'll bring you to the white house?      in.  a\tbut not always, because we don't always put that so, again, ambassador sandland specifically told us that   he had had that paragraph inserted.\tand we were, again,  somewhat nervous about that, because, again, when you make an  invitation like that and an expecta ti on is set up, you need  to have a clear idea of the timeframe and then the nature of  the discussions.  and at this particular point, we're still waiting for  the elections to the ukrainian parliament.\tso i just want to  put that on the record.  q\twhen was that going to be?  unclassified\t  a\tthat was going to be in ju ly.\twell, in actual  fact, at that poi nt  i'll have to go back and check.  perhaps we can all check whether it had actually been  announced because zelensky was under a great deal of pressure  internally, domesti cally, and also from the russi ans.  there was, you know, speculation in all analytical  circles, both in ukraine and outside, that he might not be  able to get a workable majority in the ukrainian parliament.  and all of us are very cognizant of the dangers of writing  congratulatory letters to people who can' t form governments.  we've had a number of letters, in fact, we had to pull back  where heads of state that we congratulated then couldn' t  actually form a government.  and at that point, we were very hesitant to, you know,  push forward with any invitation to zelensky until we knew  that he had a workable majority in the rada and was then  going to be able to form his own cabi net.  so myself and others were actually cautioning against  extending an i nvi tati on at that particular point until we  knew that zelensky would form a government.\twe were also  extremely concerned about zelensky's relationship wi th the  gentleman igor kolomoisky, the ukrainian oli garch, who was  the oli garch who was basi cally the owner of the tv and  production company that mr. zelensky's famous servant of the  people program had been part of.     unclassified\t  and, of course, our analysts and our embassy and others  were watching very closely  and this is playing out now in  the press and public  to see how much influence  mr. kolomoisky might have on zelensky or on government  formation.  and kolomoisky is someone who the u.s. government has  been concerned about for some time, having been suspected  and, indeed, proven to have embezzled money, american  taxpayers' money, from a bank that was subsequently  nationalized, privatbank.\tand he had gone into exile in ii\tisrael in this particular timeframe.   q   a  is he back in ukraine? so we were watching  he's gone back to ukraine.   so we were watching for exactly these kinds of eventual i ti es  and were very reluctant at that point to put a meeting on the  agenda, push for a meeting until we could see how the  complexities of ukrainian politics would play out.  q\twhat were your thoughts on zelensky in the runup to  his election victory?  a\ti had an open mind about him.\the was, you know,  somebody, you know, completely, you know, out of the  from  outside the political realm.\tobviously, you know, we asked  our analysts to, you know, get us as much information as they  could.  and, as i said, the one question we had was really  unclassified\t  whether he would be able to act independently.\the would  obviously need a major parliamentary majority for this or a  significant parliamentary majority, and whether someone like  igor kolomoisky or other oligarchs would try to predate upon  his presidency.  q\tdid you believe he was genuinely campaigning on  being an anticorruption champion?  a\tthere was a good chance that he was.\tand i'm  always one of the people, you know, trust but verify.\tso i  wanted to have a bit more information about him.   q   a  had poroshenko's time run out, you think? poroshenko's time had definitely run out.   i also want to say that, you know. in this tim eframe, we  were being very careful in the runup to the elections not to  appear, as the previous administration had done, to ti p our  hat in the election.  and we all remember the notorious phone call that the  russians basically intercepted and then put on youtube of  assistant secretary victoria nuland talking to our ambassador  geoff pyatt at the time about decisions about who should be  pri me minister of ukraine and the very damaging effect that  that had.\tso we were trying to ensure at that ti me   q\twhen did tha t occur?  a\tthat was during the  gosh, when was that  one  of the many upheavals in ukrainian politics back in the     unclassified\t  s.\ti'll have to come back to you.\tthat's one of those,  you know, trivia questions i would have failed in my pub quiz  there.  but, basically, you will all remember that it was  intercepted by the russians.\tit was a question of thenprime  minister yatseniuk about who would be more preferable for the  united states.\tand we had determined as a government that we  weren't going to play that game.\twe were not going to try to  in any case  in any shape or form suggest that poroshenko  was our candidate or that we had a preference for zelensky or ii\tany of the other candidates that were running in the  presidential race.  and that had made president poroshenko very  uncomfortable and he had been agi tat i ng for some kind of  meeting in that timeframe, i ncludi ng with the vice president  or someone as well.  q\tit's been posited that ambassador yovanovitch was  close to poroshenko, whether that 's true or untrue.  a\tthat's rubbish, just to be very clear.\tthen  anybody in the government who is interacting with poroshenko,  including the vice pres i dent, was  and the president was  close to poroshenko, and that's just not true.  q\twhen was it clear that poroshenko's time was up?  a\ti think it became, you know, very obvious in his  handling of, you know, various issues.\tthe kerch strait  unclassified\t incident could very well have been handled d i fferently .  q\twhen was that?  a\tthat was in november of .\tthey have a perfect  right to send their ships through the kerch strait, but it  seemed to us that this action, you know, was taken  it was  taken on the eve of the armistice commemorations in france,  where we'd already announced that there was going to be a  meeting between the president and president putin.\tthere was  a lot of scrutiny on other major events.  and it seemed to have been done not just with a freedom ii\tof navigation goal in mind, which, again, is\tompletely  acceptable and the right of the ukrainians, but also to gain  maximum attention.  and there was a miscalculation there.\tperhaps the  ukrainians  this is speculation on my part, but i think it  bears on an analytical basis rather than on anything else  that president poroshenko thought that the russians would  catch and release, that they would, you know, perhaps attempt  to detain the ships, not that there would be a fire fi ght,  which is actually what happened.\ti\tmean, those ships were  shot on by a russian helicopter, and one of the seamen, the  sailors, was i njured .\tand i don't think he anticipated  they'd seize both vessels and take the sailors off to moscow.  q\twas it clear that zelensky was going to be the  winner?      unclassified\t  a\tit was not.  q\tso it was trending not towards poroshenko, but it  was going to be zelensky or a third candidate?  a\tyeah.\ti mean, all the analysis, we had many  updates at the time we were doing.\tin fact, the embassy in  ukraine was doing some really excellent work on polling and  on, you know, kind of outreach to ukrainian citizens and  their think tanks.\tand it was clear that poroshe nko was  polling in the single digits, so it was an uphill battle for  him if it was a free and fair election.  so our focus was on encouraging all parts of the  ukrainian establishment to have a free and fair election, and  signaling to poroshenko that if he tri ed to steal the  election, this would not be acknowledged by the u.s.  government, that we were watching this. and to be fair to  poroshenk o, he really did run a free and fair election.\tit  was something the russians didn't expect, and it was  something i think that a lot of people did not expect.  q\thow confident were you that zelensky would be able  to get the margins he needed to form a parliament or to form  a majority?  a\tnot especi ally confi dent, to be honest , gi ven the  pressures that he was facing and also the role of the  russians in obviously targeting the ukrainian elections as  well.\tyou have to remember that before, you know, the  unclassified\t  russians targeted us and targeted other european countries  around their elections, they targeted ukraine as well.\tand  it was welldocumented that the russians were trying to run  their own candidates, people with affiliations with russian  businesses, russian oligarchs, and with the kremlin.  q\tbut, ultimately, he was able to do that in the july  election?  a\the was, because i think everyone has always  underestimated the ukrainian people's political sentiment and  grassroots.  q\tambassador volker , you touched on it a li ttle bit  in the first hour, what was his portfolio?  a\this portfolio was to conduct, as best he could, the  negotiations or give the united states a role in the  negotiations with the russians and the ukrainians to find  resolution to the war in donbas.  so his portfolio covered interactions with the normandy  format minsk group, the french and the germans and the  ukrainians and russians in that context.\the was responsible  for meetings with president puti n's designated ukrainian  envoy to the ukrainian conflict, mr. sokov.\tthat in itself  is a challenge.\tsokov is a political operator of the highest  caliber and, you know, very wellknown in russian circles.  and also to deal with other european leaders who have been,  you know, actively involved and engaging with ukraine, and      unclassified\t  our other allies, the canadians, you know, nato and others.  but it was very much focused on the resolution of the  conflict in donbas.  q\twith ambassador sondland's self assert ed authority  over at least parts of the ukrainian portfolio, who are the  other relevant u.s. officials, not rudy giuliani, but  relevant u.s. officials involved with ukraine policy at this  point?  a\tin terms of across the interagency, the equivalent  assistant secretaries and deputy assistant secretaries of  defense and at state.\tso  q\twho are they?  a\tgeorge kent is the das in charge of ukraine at the  state department.\twess mitchell was previously the assistant  secretary, but he left in february of , february of .  does that sound right?  and phil reeker came in as acting assistant secretary,  having been the special adviser to eucom, only really in  aprilmay.\tso he was actually dualhatted until the  retirement of general scaparrotti.\the was his chief adviser.  so he was, you know, doing two jobs at once.\tso i think he  was appointed of  ramed as acting assistant secretary, but  he only really was coming into the job in april.  and then, in terms of  the das is laura cooper at the  defense department.\tthen  well, we also had had a number  unclassified\t  of changes over there.\ti mean, the defense department, there  was a whole range of people who were involved in this,  because of just the nature of assistance to ukraine.\twe'd  also had general abizaid, who had been a chief military  adviser to ukraine.\the was replaced by kei th dayton, general  keith dayton, who is the head of garmisch  our military  school at garmisch.  so you had a broad range of people, people also at,  obviously, mb, departments of commerce, ustr.\tthere's a  broad range of people who were involved in one way or another ii\ton ukraine portfolio.\tdepartment of ju sti ce, the fbi.\twe  had a department of justice team working, and also in our  intel agencies as well.  q\tand in your di rectorate, could you help us  understand how your directorate was set up?  a\twe had one director for ukraine, who at this  particular juncture was alex vindman.\tour previous director   who was detailed from the defense department, he had  been  well, he still is\ta foreign area officer de tai led  to the chairm an's office, the joint chiefs of staff.\the had  been general dunford's key action officer for interactions  with the russians.  q\tand who's that?   a  q  for interactions, this is alex vindman. okay.\tthis is alex vindman.\tis he still there?       u nclassified\t  a\ti'm just giving you his background.\tto the best of  my knowledge, he's still there.\this predecessor was  catherine croft, who was previously the ukraine desk officer  at the state department, and she went to work for kurt volker  as his deputy, but only in the very last couple of months.  q\thow many officials on your staff concentrated on  ukraine?   a only alex vindman.   q how many personnel did you have in your \torganization? ii\ta\tas you're aware, there was an effort to streamline \tthe national security council.\t \t       so, basically, we didn't replace people when they rotated out  of detail.\tso some people had enormous portfoli os.  and alex vindman had initially been taken on by my   the other senior director in  the director with me, colonel  rich hooker, who had been, you know, very interested,  obviously, in defenserelated issues.  and we initially brought him on to look at the totality  of russian defense relat ed i ssues, but then there was a  determination during  in the course of the streamlining of  the nsc that that should all be concentrated in our defense  directorate.\tso another person had been taken on there to  focus on those related issues who would work closely.\tso we  unclassified\t moved alex to work on ukrain e. belarus, and moldova.  q\twhen did that occur?  a\tso he wasn't hired primarily  i t had occurred  when catherine croft left.  q\twhen was that?  a\tthat would be sometim e toward the end of the summer  of .\tevery year, in the summer of   the summer we have  a rotati on of detailees.\tmost people are there for a year.  some people get permission from their agenci es for  months.  and on rare occasions people are seconded for  years. but i i\tonly if their department is willing to pay.  and there was a big debate while i was there that people  here may recall about whether departments and agencies were  going to pay for additional time beyond the  year.   q  a  q  a  and what agencies do you draw the detailees from? every agency, if we can. such as? every agency that we can that will detail someone.    i mean. it's rare to have   q\twell, in your tenure, what were the agencies  supplying detailees?  a\twell, it depended, again, on the memorandums of  understanding.\twhen i fi rst started, the majority were from  the state department.\tbut the state department. when  secretary tillerson came in, was refusing to let people stay     unclassified\t  for longer than a year, and there was also some questions  back and forth about the downsizing of the state department.  dod i ni ti ally were more receptive to putting forward  part i cularl y foreign area officers and particularly people  from jcs.\tand there were a lot of detailees from dod in the  time that i was there across the nsc and all dir ectora tes. \t  i was try i ng to get someone actually from commerce,  because i felt li ke we needed, you know, kind of a diversity  of views, especially since an awful lot of the i ssues that we  were dealing with related to trade, especi ally when it came  to europe but also with many other countries.\tand although  that was in our internat i onal economics division, it was very  helpful to have people wi th, you know, broader backgrounds.  we had also detailees from treasury, although treasury  itself, they got shortstaffed and were trying to recall some  of their deputies in that time.  and let me just see if i've missed anyone.\tand then   q\twhich\t?  a\ti think in some cases, that would be classi fi ed.  q\tand in total, you had anywhere from  to  people  under your supervision?  a\tat some times, it was only \tbecause, often wi th  the detailees changing over, we could go weeks, you know, i  see  unclassified\t  \t      attest that, when you have a changeover of detailees, it  could   often takes a long time for people to come in, and you might  be rea lly shortstaffed.  so i have been lit eral ly down to \tdirectors, you  know, kind of total, and myself have acted as a director and  at different times have had to ask our special assistant.\twe  also had a number of special assistants.\tin my case, we were  down to only .\tspecial assistant.   q  a  the and often that was how people's portfoli os ended up   getting determined.\tso we had one colleague who had to cover  the entirety of the eastern flank of nato, i mean plus  countries because, when\tcame in, the other previ ous.  directors who were divided up between them had left.\tand  did that job for several months and actually did it so well  that we decided not to hire an extra deputy.\twas  basically working hour days, however.   q  a   q  switching gears back to the july th meeting. yes. the next sort of key event was the july th call   with president trump and president zelensky.\tyou had left  shortly prior    a\ti had.     unclassified\t  q\tprior to the call.\tbut what was the preparation  for that call underway?  a\tit was not because the call had not been announced  when i lef t.  q\tso you di dn't know the call was scheduled   a\ti did not.  q\tas of july th?  a\tas of ju ly th, i did not know it was scheduled.  and on july th was the last day that i had formal io\tinteragency meetings.\tand from july th, th, th and  th, i had meetings myself just to wrap up and, you know,  kind of basically pass on information about the portfolio to i \trelevant people, including across the interagency.  q\twho did you pass your portfolio on to?  a\ti passed my port foli o on to tim morrison.\tand so  any meetings that were pertinent to ukraine in that timeframe  of that week, he attended with alex vindman, although  actually, to be honest, i think he was traveling in that  period.\the went to take part in  he may have been back by  the thursday  an arms control meeting with the state  \tdepartment because he came over, as you know, from being the \tsenior director for arms control.  \tq\tdid he at any point work for you, morrison?   a  q  work for me? yes.  unclassified\t  a\tno, he did not.\the was my counterpart in weapons  of mass destruction.  q\tthen he came over to take your job?   a\tcorrect.  q\twhy did you decide to leave the white house?  a\ti had always said when i came in:\ti'm a  nonpart isan, nonpolitical appointee.\ti was hired, in fact,  by general flynn, k.t. mcfarland, and general kellogg.\tand  when they fi rst approached me and asked me if i would be  willing to do this, i had previously taken a leave from ii brookings, i was on ipa to the nati onal intelligence office.  so i had actually worked with general flynn when he was  working for admiral mullen at the j oi nt chiefs of staff when  i was a national intelligence officer.\tand i said that i  couldn't commit to longer than  years, maximum.\tin actual  fact, i stayed longer because i agreed to help with  transition, finding new directors, and also trying to find a  successor and to be able to do a handover.\tand i said i was  willing to stay no later than the end of the year to do this.  and tim morrison wanted to start on july th.   q  a  q  a  so you're nonpartisan? i am nonpartisan. in this current environment we're i n, it's ­ that's actually why i took the job.\tbecause in   this current environment we're in, i think it's extremely     unclassified\t  important for people who are nonpart i san to serve in  government posi ti ons.  q\tat any poi nt as you were onboarding, was it  d i d  you fin d that you were ostracized because you weren't  associ ated with the more partisan si de of the house?  a\ti got ostracized by   mr. wolosky: what do you mean?\tostracized by whom?  dr. hill:\tyeah, by whom?\tnot by anybody in the  republican party, but i did have a colleague who had io\tprevi ously ii\tby mr. castor:   q  a  like were you   who has not spoken to me since i took the job,   but for the opposite reasons from what you are suggesting.  q\tand how would you characterize, were you a  supporter of the president?\twere you agnostic?  a\ti was agnosti c.\tand i don't think that there's  anything wrong wi th that ei ther.\ti was, bas i cally, like i  said, in the case of zelensky and many others, i think  everyone should have a very open mind.\tand i think i t's very  important to serve your country and to serve the president  and the presi dency , you know, as being duly elected.  and i thought it was very im portant to step up, as an  expert, as somebody who's been working on russia for  basi cally my whole entir e adult life, given what had happened  unclassified\t  in  and given the peril that i actually thought that we  were in as a democracy, given what the russians i know to  have done in the course of the  elections.  q\tso you say you were agnostic on the president, so  you hadn't been a critic of the president?  a\ti had not.\tthere are a couple of articles where i  expressed some, you know, skepticism about how his  relationship would be with putin that, you know, kind of  perhaps didn't prove to be true, but anyway.  so. i mean, you can look back and, you know, see that, i i\tyou know, i suggested they might not get along, you know,  kind of because. you know, given the different natures of the  individuals. i thought, you know, there might be some  friction.  q\tat any point, did you find yourself becoming a  critic of the president?  a\ti did not.\tand if i had done, i would have left  right away, and i left only on terms.\tand a lot of people  and i'm just going to put this out there.\tyou haven't asked  the question, but i have been accused of it many times.\ti  did not write anonymous.\ti am not anonymous.\tso just to say  that because   q\ti didn't ask you that.  a\t lee has been having endless phone calls from  people, and i was accused of that within the white house.\tit     unclassified\t  was the most uncomfortable time that i had.\tit was the only  time when i experienced discomfort.\tbecause of people  parsi ng everything i had written.\tand micha el anton, who was  the head of the press at that time, was fielding endless  calls from people saying that i was anonymous.\tand i was  not, and i will state it for the record:\ti was not.  q\tbut you didn't leave the white house because you  found yourself becoming a critic of the president?  a\tno, i didn't.\ti had given myself  years.\ti  stayed longer than that.\tbut, as a nonpartisan person, i did ii not want to be part of the campaign  q\tand even since you've left the white house, you  don't find yourself as a critic of the president?  a\ti have not return ed to the brookings instituti on.  i'm on leave.\tand i have not taken on any speaking  engagements.\ti am not writing a book.\ti am basically trying  to keep my head down, you know, while everybody else is  trying to do their jobs.\ti worked with the most unbelievably  professional firstrate team of people, both political and  nonpolitical, in the time i was at the nsc, and i want to  give them the space to do their jobs.  q\tthe july th call, who would ordinarily be a  participant on that call?  a\tthat really could vary because it also, you know,  depends  i mean, there were calls that i would have been  unclassified\t  ordinarily on, but i wasn't there or present.\ti might have  been in another meeting or i might not have actually been  physically in the building.  so it would usually be  well, again, it often would be  selected by the front office of the national security advisor  as well as, you know, the kind of the broader white house  team.\tyou would imagine someone from the chief of staff's  office, someone representing the national security advi sor ,  which could be the deputy.\tit could be myself, as the senior  d i rector, or the director if i'm not present.\tsomeone from  the vice pres i dent's staff.\toften someone from press or the  white house counsel.  and if there was an anti ci pati on tha t a particular topic  in somebody else's area of responsi bi li ty would come up  say, it's a call with chancellor merkel and she wants to talk  about   let's just pick a random  libya, then the director  who has responsi bi li ty and the senior directors for libya  would basically also be present.  so i can't say for sure, you know, who would normally  have been in those meetings, but that's usually  i mean   and then you have the white house situation room staff , and  then other cabinet members can call in as well.  now, also remember that there's another side to all of  these calls.\tso, while people start parsing who's in our  calls, all of those calls could very easily be being recorded      unclassified\t  as well as transcribed by a very la rg e phalanx of other  people on the other side of the call.\tand i will, you know,  refer you to look at pictures that, for example, president  erd ogan of turkey would frequently release with himself  listening to the call with about as many people as are  sitting here in this room.         ii                           unclassif ied\t    by mr. castor:  q\tdid you speak with anyone?\tyou had left on the  th, but had you spoken to anybody about the call?  a\ti did not.\ti was on vacation\tand at  the time the phone call took place, i think, based on my  datestamp on my phones, i was snorkeling.  voice:\tyou were under water.  dr. hill:\ti was under water, yeah.\tit was a pretty  good alibi.\ti di dn 't take underwater pi ctures, but, you  know, i can basically  by mr. castor:   q   a   q   a   q   a  so you didn't receive any readouts of the call ­ i did not.  until it became public ­ i did not.  on the th? no, i did not.\ti'd actually asked people   i said   i'd promise i would check my email once a day  and there  was a big time difference as well, so that was quite  and i  would forward on to them anything that they needed to deal  with and, otherwise, i would prefer if they didn' t call me.  q\tokay.\tbut you were getting your email, so you saw  the traffic from your    a\tthat was the fi rst i saw that there was a call.                       secure system, because one should assume that, in those kinds  of emails, anybody could be reading them.  q\tright. i i\twhen is the first time you learned about the call and  its nature?  a\treally when it was started to be made public.\tthe  first hint that i got that there might have been some  discomfort about it was when i was handing back in my badge  on september rd.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tand i went in to talk to my office, and i said, how  are things going, and people said, well, not great.\tand i  thought, well, okay, something is up.\tbut there wasn't  any  i mean, i was comi ng in to hand in my badge, so i was  technically no longer  q\tuhhuh.  a\tand i had a very brief discussion with ti m  morri son, and he didn' t mention the call at all.\the did take  unclassified\t  the time to tell me that gordon sondland was apparently glad  that i had gone.\tso i thought, well, that was a rather  pointed message from ambassador sondland.\tbut i didn't take  that to be about the call or anythi ng else.\tit just seemed  to be a fairly gratuitous, you know, kind of messaging as i  was leav i ng.  q\tso ambassador sondland didn't attend your farewell  party?   a  q   a   q   a  he d i dn' t.\tno. did you have one? sort of. and when was that? that would 've been in the week i was leaving.\ti   can't remember when it was, honestly.  q\tbut back in july?  a\tjune or july, yeah.  q\twhere was it?  a\tit was just in the white house.\twe had a lot of  farewell parties in that period.\twell, it was because people  are rotating out, and everybody likes to go and relax and see  their friends.  mr. j ordan:\tdoctor, you mentioned on september rd you  got a hint of the call or the content of   dr. hill:\tno, i had more a hint that something was up,  but i di dn 't know exactly what .     unclassified\t  mr. jordan:\tnot a hint of the call, just a hint that  something was up.  dr. hill:\tyeah.\tpeople didn't look very happy in my  dir ectorat e.  mr. jordan:\tokay.  by mr. castor:  q\twho did you speak with when you came to turn in  your badge?  a\ti spoke to resource management, the fi nanc i al  people, the ethics people.\tand i also did have a very brief i i\tdiscussion with john eisenberg and michael elli s, who i met  with very frequently on a whole number of issues and had a  really excellent, you know, professional relationship with.  and i asked them if there was anything that i should be  mindful of as i was leaving, in terms of communications.  because i'd seen an emai l suggesting, again, that we had to  keep all communications related to ukraine.\tthere'd been an  email sometime in that timeframe.\tand i just wanted to tell  them that i'd put everything into the records, and was there  anything that i needed to know, and they didn't indicate that  there was.  q\tdid you talk to vin dman?  a\ti did not talk to alex vindman, no.  q\twhat did eisenberg and ellis tell you about your  records?  unclassified\t  a\tthey said that, as long as i was having no, you  know, kind of official communications, that there was no, you  know, reason to be concerned, and just asked me what i'd done  with all of my records.  q\tlike, all your notes that you take in meetings?  a\tcorrect.\tand i'd already filed all of those with  the records office on the th.  q\tokay.\tso you didn't take any   a\ti took nothing with me.  q\t of your own notes with you?  a\tno.\tall i took with me was my  the ethics and,  you know, fi nanc i al agreements.\tand the reason that i didn't  hand my badge in unti l september rd  because i was on  vacation until the th  is tha t you have to fill out all  the ethics paperwork on your last  or immediately after  your last payday.  q\tyeah.  a\tand you can only then sign out of all of the  resource management .\tit's just, you know, kind of a  bureaucratic thing.  mr. jordan:\tdoctor, you said you learned about the call  about the time of when it was publi c.\tdoes that mean you  learned about it prior to the th?\tor when did you learn  about the contents and the nature of the call?  mr. wolosky:\ti believe that misstates her prior      unclassified\tio i  testimony over when she learned about the call, when she  continued to have access to her nonclassified email.\tthe  record will speak for itself.  mr. jordan:\tno, but she  earlier, she said  she  said a hint of a call, and she clarified that and said that  wasn't about the call necessarily, just a hint of something.  dr. hill:\tyeah, i was alert to the fact that people  didn't look happy and something was up, but i didn't put it  together with the call.  mr. jordan:\tand there was no time between \tseptember rd, when you had a hint of something up, and \tseptember th that you learned about the contents of the  call?  dr. hill:\tno, i did not learn about the contents of the  call.\ti did learn, as a result of lots of media calling  me  i was with\t, and i had  very poor      has a wifi router that doesn't extend  beyond, you know, kind of, bas i cally this desk.\ti had to sit  on it to basically get a text.\tand i basically ran through  my entire data plan.\tand when i eventually called   to get the data plan extended ,i\t \t \t   when it came back on, i had found i had just bazillions  of texts and emails from press.\tand i didn't know what was  unclassified\t  going on.\tand i texted   nsc and a call.\tand i texted   it was clearly about , who was   not actually di rectly related to all of this, and said,  what's going on?\twhat i do need to know?\twhy am i getting   all of these calls?\tand  said, it's the   whistleblower account, and it's relat ed to the ukraine call.  mr. j ordan:\tthat was before the th?  dr. hill:\tthat would've been  because i came back on  the th with\t, so it was in  the couple of days before that.\ti basically read about  everything as i was sitting in newark airport in the transit  area with  mr. jordan:\tuhhuh.\tand who was  ?  dr. hill:\tthe   \t   \t\t·  and we kept a very close separation of issues,  especially on russi a.\trussia was highly coordinated, highly  professional.\tand we kept all the russia stuff out of  everything else, because there was a tendency for people to  leak information about russia, and we wanted to make sure  that that did not happen .  mr. zeldin:\tif i   excuse me.\tif i could ask a quick  followup on that?  unclassified\t  so, earlier on in your testimony, you stated that you  like to keep your head down.\teven without being asked, you  stated that you're not the person who wrote the anonymous new  york times   dr. hill:\ti've been asked about every single other time  by every imaginable press person, and all of the people who  are emailing me, who don't know me, are asking that.\tso i  thought i would just get it on the record so that i t's not,  you know, kind of, a question that is all hovering over  people's minds. ii mr. zeldin: yeah, no, i appreciate that.\tbut that's  why your last answer just sparked my interest, and i just  wanted to ask a followup question.\thow would so many in the  media have your phone number?  dr. hill:\ti used to work at a thi nk tank, the brookings  inst i tuti on.\tin fact, i'm   mr. zeldin:\tit was all from before you were in the  white house?  dr. hill:\ti am technically, you know, supposed to go  back there.\tand i haven't gone back there because you can't  really shelter in place at somewhere like the brookings  institution when something like this is going on.\tand what i  mean by that is, i'm obliged as part of the job as a senior  fellow to talk to the media and to the press and to make  public pronouncements.  unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\tso  \tdr. hill:\tand brookings has, very sadly,       mr. zeldin:\tokay.\tbut you weren't giving out your  phone number to the media while in your position at the white   house?  dr. hill:\tno.  and i'll be very clear, and you can ask any of the press  directors, that i only ever gave background interviews at the ii\trequest of the white house, in cludi ng the press secretary on  the nsc, with nsc press or white house press available.\ti  never, on any occasion, talked to the media outside of those  circumstances  background, authorized interviews.\ti did  not leak any information.\ti did not talk to the press.  i was accused of many things, and that's why i'm just  saying that it gets my back up when people like masha  yovanovitch and others were accused baselessly of doing all  kinds of improper activity.  and i did not leak, and i was not anonymous.\ti am not  the whistleblower.\tand i'm not the second whistleblower.  just get this all for the record so we have it all out there  and you don't have to ask any more questions about that.  by mr. castor:  q\tyeah, well, you know, if i may just walk you     unclassified\t  through this.\twe first heard about you coming in for today's  allday interview, allday deposition, last wednesday night.  nobody told us earlier than wednesday.\ti contacted your  lawyer on thursday to try to find out a little bit more  information and was unable to connect with your lawyer.\twe  were in here all day friday.\tand, finally, i connected with  your lawyer for about  minutes last night.  and so you have to understand that when we're trying to  prepare ourselves and prepare our members, we are being kept  in the dark.\tso you just have to excuse the fact that we're  going to have some questions about who were the people you  worked for.  a\tno, i completely understand.\tand i think, you  know, my reaction is not because of you at all.\ti mean, it's  the, you know, kind of, just the onslaught that i have been  getting.\ti've had media inquiries and, you know, people i  don't know at all  q\tgot it.  a\tyou know, working  i' m on youtube.\ti'm, you  know, on the internet.  q\tokay.  a\tmy\tis panicked that, you know, kind of,  \tgoing to be targeted.\tyou know, there are   q\twell, certainly, that is   a\tso i'm respondi ng to, you know, all these  unclassified\t  suspicions about who i am as a person.\tand, again, i am a  nonpartisan professional.\tand that's just what i wanted to  have on the record .  q\tdr. hill, we appreciate your service and have  enormous respect for you and, you know, the likeminded  nonpartisan people that serve in the nat i onal security  council.\tand, good heavens, anything that can be likened to  a threat and anything with\t, good heavens, tha t  is something that nobody, on the republican side or the  democratic side, will  ii\ta\tno, i'm aware that this is not you at all.\tit's  just, as you said, when you asked me a question before, given  the environment   q\tbut just let me be clear that we find that type of  thing to be absolutely abhorrent, and we want to assist you  in any way possible to minimize that.  a\tno, i appreciate that.  q\tcan you help us understand, li ke, when is the first  time you heard the committee had an i nterest in speaking with  you?  mr. wolosky:\ti'm going to instruct her not to answer  that question to the extent that it calls for communications  with her attorney that are covered by attorneyclient   privilege.  mr. castor:\tokay.     unclassified\t like, how did they know you were represented by  mr. wolosky then?  dr. hill:\twhen i asked mr. wolosky to   mr. castor:\tand when  like, was it earlier than last  wednesday?  mr. wolosky:\tyeah, i mean, i think that if you want to  ask a question to the witness, she will answer the question  to the extent that she has personal knowledge.\tif you want   to ask a question to me, i'm not the witness in these jo\t\tproceedings.  i\tmr. castor:\ti don't want to ask a question of you.  i just want to know generally when you first became  aware the committee had an interest in speaking with you.  dr. hill:\ti became aware of it, actually, when the  chairman released the letter publicly about what the  because, you know, my title is on that list.\tit said current  and former.  mr. castor:\tokay.  dr. hill:\tand so i assumed    mr. castor:\tokay.  dr. hill:\t  and i hope that it was a correct  assumption   based on the very thorough list of all the  people that you intended to call for depositions, that that  would cover me.  mr. castor:\tokay.  unclassified\t  dr. hill:\tnow, the title has changed somewhat.\tit was  europe and russia when i was the senior director.\tit's been  changed to european affai rs or, you know, european issues or  whatever i t's been changed to now.  mr. castor:\tokay.\tand do you remember when that was,  generally?  dr. hill:\twell, whenever the chairman published the  letter that was put in the media.  mr. castor:\twhen is the first time you learn ed the  committee attempted to contact you specifically? ii\tdr. hill:\ti saw that my name was on  oh, not my name,  not my name in person, but my function and my job  was on  the list.\tso i assumed that, at some point, i would be asked  to testi fy or to speak to someone in some fashion.  and i've known lee for  years.\tand on my fi rst day  back,   \t              •    you need a lawy er.\tand i thought, who do i know? oh, i know lee. mr. castor:\tand when was that, the th? mr. wolosky:\t\tthank you for the endorsement.   dr. hill:\ti know he's a great lawye r.\ti know he's a  great lawyer, just to add to all of that.\tbut i've known him      unc l ass i f i e d\t since before he was a lawyer.\tlee's like, great, now i'm \tgoing to have no more cli ents.

•\twould tell me that i should  and i dismissed it at  first, but then, as the news media picked up on this, i  thought .\twas probably right.  u nclassified\t q\tand when did you first realize that, i ndeed , they  wanted to speak with you?  a\twell, that's when  mr. wolosky:\ti mean, again, to the extent that that  involves communications with me, i'm going to instruct her  not to answer that question.  mr. castor:\tuhhuh.  by mr. castor:  q\tthe documents produced last night, are you familiar  with what was produced on your behalf?   a  q  the  yes, i am.\tyeah. and what were the circumstances. to the extent you   know, not i nvolvin g communications with your lawyer, but how  was that produced?\tyour calendar entries, is that something  that you had with you?  a\ti di dn' t actually have it with me.  q\tokay.\tthere was a range.  a\tmy assistant at the nati onal security council    q\tokay.  a\tactually kept the calendar.\tand it's only  but only for the year in which he was working there.  q\tright.  a\tand i was asked to, you know, obviously, establish  a timeline, you know, and what meetings i would've been  available in.\tand i asked him if he had kept a copy of the      unclassified\ti i l  calendar that i would be able to refer to to make sure that  we got at least, you know, kind of, the meetings that the  committee was most interested in in sequence.   q the handwritten notes on the calendar, is that ­  a that was just me circling   q okay.  a  you know, what i thought would be most  perti nent, and also pointing out that i wasn't  because the  calendar had entries for after i had already left.   q   a  sure.\ti think on the th it said i'd gone or something, on vacation, or handed    over the   q   a  and is that your hand writ i ng? yeah, that's my handwriting.\tbecause he gave it to   me and i looked.\tand i only had one copy of thi s.    q   a  okay. and, again, this is me trying to establish the   facts as best i can, because, as you know  you know it.\ti  mean, i can't have total recal l of every   q\toh, of course not.  \ta\t  you know, single timing and things as well.  q\tand i don't expect you to.  a\tyeah.\tyeah.  mr. wolosky:\tcan i have just  minute?  dr. hill:\tyeah.\tplease.\tyeah.  unclassified\t    dr. hill:\tyeah, i just also wanted to mention that, you  know, obviously, in terms of documents and document  retent i on, everything was fi led in accordance with the  requirements from records.  and i had asked on that last day that i was in the  office, on september rd, if i could have a copy for  reference of my contacts database, because i wanted to be  able to pass on to tim morrison and to other colleagues names  of ambassadors and ambassadors' staff.\tand all of those ii\tthings are unaccessible to your successor when you leave.\ti  mean , the accounts are all closed down.  and that was the similar  i asked if my assistant, who  was actually working in the transi ti on period for tim  morrison, could have access to the calendar that he had kept  for me in that time so that tim and others would be able to  refer back to when i had a particular meeting.\tbecause, i  mean, i t's obviously important for the presidential record  and for, you know, record keepi ng and for directorate  continuity purposes to know when the predecessor met with  whom, you know, which ambassador or, you know, which other  official.  by mr. castor:   q   volker?  you always had a good relationship with ambassador      unclassified\tl i   a\ti did.\tvery good relationship with him.  q\ti think we're clear where you stand with ambassador  sandland, but   a\ti actually had a very good relationship, i thought,  at the very beginning with ambassador sandland.\tbut the  unfortunate thing was i had a blowup with him    q\tright.  a\t in june, when he told me that he was in charge   of ukraine, because initially i said to him, you're not,  with that kind of, you know, surprise and probably irritation ii\tin my voice.   q   a  right.\tright. and then he got testy with me.\tand i said, who has    put you in charge of it?\tit seemed like, hi, i'm in charge.  you know, there's no ambassador here.\twell, at that point,  charge  ambassador taylor had been sent out.  and i said, who has said you' re in charge of ukraine,  gordon?\tand he said, the president.\twell, that shut me up,  because you can't really argue with that.\tbut then i  wasn't\tto be honest, i wasn't really sure.  q\tbut ambassador volker always acted with integrity?  a\the did.  q\tin the interest of the united states?  a\the did.\ti have to say, though, that we did say to  him that we did not thi nk it\twas a good idea for him talking  unclassified\t  to rudy gi uli ani .  q\tand how did he respond to that?  a\the said tha t he thought that he would be able to  i don't think he used exactly these words, but be able to  reason with him and to, you know, kind of, basically, you  know, manage this.\twell, we did not think that this was  manageable .  and ambassador bolton made it very clear that nobody  should be talking to rudy giuliani, on our team or anybody  else should be.  q\tyou may have had a disagreement with ambassador  sandla nd, like you just recounted, but, i mean, he always was  acting in the best interests of the uni ted states, to the  best of your knowledge, correct?  a\tto the best of my knowledge, correct.  q\tokay.\the   a\tambassador sandland, i' m afraid, you know, i felt,  you know, as i menti oned before, he was driving along on the  road.\tyou know, he'd just gone off the road.\tno guardra i ls ,  no gps.  q\tright.  a\tand my main concern, that he was wading into, not  just on ukraine but many other issues, everything which he  was not being properly briefed.\tand we reached out to his  team at the eu mission, and they weren' t giving him briefings      unclassif ied\t   on thi s.  q   a    ri ght. and, again, that's why i asked    to try to find some time to sit with him and to encourage him  again not to use his personal phone, not to use other  people's personal phone, not to give people's personal phone  numbers out.  q\tyeah.  a\ti mean, he\ti am pretty confident that he was,  you know, doing what he thought was, you know, the right i \tthing to get agreements made and to furthe r relat i onshi ps,  but he wasn' t doing it in a way that was, you know, going to  basi cally make for good process.\tand he was also doi ng this  in a way that i thought put him at risk.  q\twho is we?\tyou sai d we.  a\tambassador bolton, assistant secretary reeke r ,  under secretary hale, deputy assi stant kent.  q\tokay.  a\ti could just go on and on.  i mean  and, also, we had complai nts from other  ambassadors about ambassador sondland, that he was wading  into their areas.\the would show up i n their countr i es  wi thout bei ng, you know, kind of\twi thout really much  foreknowledg e.\tin some cases they were pleased, and in other  cases they were not.\tand he would piggyback onto other  unclassified\t  people's visits when they wanted to, you know, basically, as  the ambassador, shepherd their head of state to visit, and he  would be there too.  q\tand he wasn't a foreign service officer.\the was  new to the experience, right?  a\the was new to the experience.\ti mean, he was  clearly, you know, a savvy guy.\the's charming.\the's funny.  he was wellmeaning.\ti mean, a lot of the stories that have  been in the press about him paying for things, actually i  thi nk he was doing that out of generosity.\the was truly  trying to build up morale in his embassy.\this embassy loved,  you know, the kind of treats and things that he would get for  them.\the was trying to create happy hours.  i think he was, in the spirit of being, obviously, a  pretty good hotelier, he was, you know, trying to do the  hospitality part of the embassy, which is actually an  important part of being an ambassador.  q\tambassador volker related to us that he was  engaging with mr. giuliani because he believed that giuliani  was amplifying a negative narrative and he had the ear of the  president, and so he was trying to make the best of this  truism.\tis that a   a\tthat's exactly what he told me as well.\ti mean, i  beg to differ, because i didn't think that this was actually  going to be very helpful.\tbecause the more you engage with     unclassified\t  someone who is spreading untruths, the more validity you give  to those untruths.  q\tbut volker's initiatives here and sondland's  initiatives here, is it your testimony that you believe they  were trying to do what's in the best interests of the united  states?  a\ti do believe that they were trying to do that.  q\tall right.\tand they're men of integrity?  a\ti know kurt volker definitely to be a man of  integrity.\tand in terms of gordon sondland, based on my  interactions with him, i've already expressed the concerns,  but i can't say that he's not a man of integrity.  and he definitely was very enthusiastic in all of our  early initial meetings about serving the united states,  serving the president, and really trying to do as good a job  as possi ble to also patch up our relations with the european  union, which were quite rocky.  and, you know, from all reports that i was getting back  from eu ambassadors, they actually appreciated his outreach  and felt that he was very open   q\tright.  a\tand they thought, you know, he was really trying  very hard.  q\tokay.\tso he wasn't part of the lev parnas and igor  fruman  unclassified\t a\ti don't think he even knew who those gentlemen  were  q\tokay.  a\tbecause in the meeting where i had a bit of a  blowup with him, i said   q\tokay.   a\tgordon, you're in over your head.  you know who these people are.  q\tokay.  i don't think   a\tbecause i also, myself, d i dn' t know who all of i i\tthese people were either.\ti'd only heard their names.\tand  from what i could gather from just, you know, a quick google  and, you know, kind of, opensource search, they seemed to be  bad news.  q\tyeah.  and volker, he related to us that the president had a  deeprooted skeptical view on ukraine and their corruption  environment.\tis that something that you can attest to?  a\ti think the president has actually quite publicly  said that he was very skeptical about corruption in ukraine.  and, in fact, he's not alone, because everyone has expressed  great concerns about corruption in ukraine.  q\tand, you know, ambassador volker related the  presi dent's business experience in the region and his  knowledge of other business executives that may have tried to     unclassified\t  do business in the ukraine contributed to his deeprooted  views of ukraine and corruption.\tis   a\tcorrect.  q\t that something you can attest to?  a\twell, i can attest to that, because, again, the  president has said this publicly.  q\tand then, you know, additionally  dr. hill:\tcan i make a quick request to have a quick  bathroom break?  mr. castor:\tyeah, we've got about  minutes  ii dr. hill:\tyeah, i'm not trying to cut you off.\ti'm  just sort of thinking i'd really like to go to the bathroom.  mr. castor:\twe've got about  minutes left.\twould you  want to   dr. hill:\tcould we just literally take a quick break?  mr. castor:\tyes, of course.  dr. hill:\tbecause i've been kind of waiting for a  pause.  mr. castor:\twe can always take a break.  the chairman:\twe'll take a quick break.    the chairman:\twe're back on the record.  by mr. castor:  q\twe were talking about president trump's  what was  at least related to us as his deeprooted skeptical view of  unclassified\t  ukraine as a businessman, as both himself in the region and  also with his colleagues.\tbut he also had a skepticism as a  result of allegations in the  election.  is that also fair to say, that the president harbored  some skepti ci sm, whether based on, you know, legitimate  reasons or not, that he did harbor some reservations about  ukraine?  mr. wolosky:\ti think you should limit your comments to  publi c statements unless there is  absent a ruling from the  chairman on the issue of privilege.  dr. hill:\tyeah, but i think he said it repeatedly in  public, you know, kind of recently as well.  by mr. castor:  q\ti'm not asking about your personal communications  with the president.\ti' m talking about your understanding, as  an official with responsibility for this area, that the  presi dent harbored skepticism.   a\the's  own statements.  expressed it openly in the press pool and his   q\tyou know, the u.s.ukrainian relations, you know,  obviously, you have the president speaking with presi dent  zelensky.\tbut you also have a fairly robust set of, you  know, staff\tat the national security council, at the state  department, the dod, other agencies.\tyou know, you had kurt  volker, phil reeker, wess mitchell, george kent.\twe have     unclassified\t bi ll taylor.\tand i apologize for not using their official  ti tles.  a\tthat's all right.\tno worries, no worries.\tyeah.  q\ti mean no disrespect by that.  a\tyeah.  q\tand so, to the extent there may have been some, you   know, comments exchanged on the call. i sn' t there a  relat iv ely robust i nfra structure around the relationship to  help steer anything into the types of backandforths  u.s. and ukraine ought to be having? ii\ta\thang on.\tcan you clari fy again?\tso, absent the   q\tso the presi den t, you know  absent the  pres i den t's call with president zelensky, there is an  i nfras tructu re of staff, at the state department, at nati onal  security council, that are interacting with   a\tright.\tokay.  q\t ukraine offi ci als to help everyone understand  some of the va r i ous things that are bei ng requested.  a\tyes.  q\ti mean. isn't that   a\tyeah, but i'm not quite sure what the question is,  though.\ti mean, are you  what are you suggesting?  q\twell, you know, there's discussion about, you know,   and burisma.\tand, you know, we saw the backandforth  on text about whether ther e's goi ng to be a statement in  unc la s s i f i ed\t  advance of the white house meeting.\tand what we saw, i  thi nk, in that exchange is that there was a, you know, good  bit of staff work going back and forth that ultimately led to  a conclusion where no statement was issued.  mr. wolosky:\twe're sort of losing you here.\tit's an  extremely long, compound question.\tyou're referring to text  messages that are not being presented as exhibits.\tso we're  happy to respond to a question if there 's a clear, specific  quest i on that you have for her.  by mr. castor:  q\tthere is an infrastructure of staff dealing with  the u.s.ukrainian relationship.  a\ton that parti cular issue that you're talk i ng about,  actually there was not.\ti mean, if you're talking about the  preparation for the call.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tand that was what i was explaining before about why \tjuly th was so problematic.\tbecause, normally, there is  indeed an interagency process that goes together in  preparation for a call.  q\tvolker related to us that he got a readout from  both the ukrainian and the u.s. side and nobody mentioned  hunter biden or .  the chairma n:\tyou know, i just want to caution counsel,  we can't vet what counsel is saying was represented in      unclassified\t  earli er witness tes ti mony.\tso if you have a question about  the facts for the witness, rather than representing what  prior witnesses have said, that might be more appropriate.  mr. wolosky:\tlet me put it another way.\tthe witness is  happy to testify to areas that are within her personal  knowledge, not mr. volker's personal knowledge.\tso i'd ask  you to please direct your questions to her personal  knowledge.  mr. goldman:\ttime.  the chairma n:\tdo you want to finish the last question? ii\t\tdr. hil l:\tyeah.\ti'm trying to fi gure it out what it is  that you're trying to figure out.  by mr. castor:  q\tmy question is, there is an infrastructure of staff  at the state department to manage the relationship.  a\tthere i s infrastructure to manage the relationship.  q\tand all these people, as you've testified, have  acted with  you know, are individuals of high integrity.  a\tbut they were not coordinating across the  governm ent.\ti can be pretty confident, based on where i left  thi ngs on ju ly th, that nobody beyond ambassador volker and  ambassador sondland knew what they were doing, beyond chief  of staff mulvaney  because ambassador bolton and\tboth  ambassador sondland and ambassador bolton referred to  mulvaney.\tsondland said repeatedly he was meeting with chief  unclassified\t  of staff mulvaney.\tand that was it.\tit was not going down  to the rest of the staff.  when i left, i did several things in the week that i  left just to wrap up.\ti had a discussion with george kent ,  telli ng him where i knew things stood and telling him\tand  this was not knowi ng that there was going to be a call,  because i don't think it was actually at all even scheduled  at this point or even thought of   q\tuhhuh.  a\t warning him that i was very worried about this ii\twhole engagement between sandland and giuliani and with kurt  and that he should be mindful of thi s, and i thought that it  was starting to take on different dimensions, i nclud i ng, you  know, this reference to, you know, energy corruption.  although, when i spoke to george, i didn't have a full  picture.\ti just told him that he should be really mindful  and be careful on this.  and on the very last day, on the th, i had a phone  call with ambassador taylor relati ng everythi ng that i knew  at that point.\ti was sort of sending out red flag s for him  and telling him, there's a lot of stuff going on here that we  have no insight into and that you need to, you know, kind of,  figure out and get on top of this.  and i told him at that point that ambassador sandland  had told me that he was in charge of ukraine.\tand that was      unclassified\t  also news to ambassador taylor.  the chairman:\tlet's pause here.\twe'll take a minute  break to either wolf down lunch or get lunch, and then we'll  resume in  minutes.    the chairman:\tokay.\twe'll go back on the record.  mr. goldman.  mr. goldman:\tthank you, mr. chairman.  by mr. goldma n:  q\tdr. hill, before, at the tail end of our initial ii\tround, you were describing the circumstances around the \tjuly th meeting at the white house.  a\tyes.  q\tand i believe you said that, after you came back  from meeting in the ward room with the ukrainian counterpar ts  and the other american officials, you went and spoke to  ambassador bolton  a\tuhhuh .  q\t\tright?\tand did you i nform him of what had just  transpired in the ward room?  \ta\tyes, i did.  q\tand could you just tell us again what he said to  you at that point?  a\the told me, as i stated before, to go and talk to  john eisenberg.\tand he basically  he said, you go and tell  unclassified\t  john eisenberg  you go and tell eisenberg that i am not  part of this drug deal that sondland and mulvaney are cooking  up.  q\tand what did you understand   a\the was saying that sarcastically, of course, i  mean, just to be clear.\tactually, he was angry, but he was  also sarcasti c.\ti mean, he wasn't  q\tright, because  a\tinferring that they were cooking up an actual   drug deal in the ward room. ii\tq\tright.\tso   a  q  just to be clear. so we're clear, because somet im es   a\tyeah, i know.\tthis could lead to some conspiracy  theories and  yeah.  q\tyes.\tand sometimes our colleagues don't understand  parody or sarcasm, so   a\tno.\tambassador bolton has a reputation for being  sarcastic and, you know, for basically using those kinds of  expressions.  q\tokay.\tbut what did you understand him to mean by  that?  a\twell, based on what had happened in the july th  meeting and ambassador sondland blurting out that he'd  already gotten agreement to have a meeting at the white house      unclassified\t  for zelensky if these investigations were started up again,  clearly ambassador bolton was referring directly to those.  and ambassador bolton had said repeatedly that nobody  should be meeting with giuliani.\tand you may recall before  that i said that he described giuliani as a bit of a hand  grenade that was going to blow everyone up.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tand he was obviously, at that point, you know,  closely monitoring what mr. giuliani was doing and the  messaging that he was sending out.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tso this is also against the backdrop, as all of you  will recall, of mr. giuliani 's frequent appearances on  television.\tand i can't say that i caught all of them, but i  was getting them relayed to me by, you know, other staff  members.\tand, often  i mean, you' ve all, no doubt, been in  the national security council buildings and the white house.  there's tvs everywhere.\tso, i mean, i could often just walk  down the corridor and catch mr. giuliani on the television.  q\tbut ambassador bolton specifically referenced  mr. sondland and mr. mulvaney, who   a\tcorrect.\tand he had said previously  i mean, we  had regular meetings with ambassador volker, you know, in  which, you know, getting back to mr. castor's questions, they  were all about the, you know, regular coordination of what we  unclassified\t  were trying to do on ukraine, you know, trying to get the  russians to start meeting with ambassador volker again, see  if we could move forward on the donbas.\tambassador bolton  made it very clear that, you know, again, he di dn't think  anybody should be dealing with giuliani.  q\tand who did he make that clear to?  a\the expressed it in one of the meetings with  ambassador volker.\tbut, at that point, i don't think he was  fully aware of the extensive meetings that ambassador volker  was having.\tthis may have been early on, when ambassador  volker had just started to meet with giuliani.  because i only, actually, to be honest, became familiar  with the tim eli ne once it was all published in the press.  because we'd already said to  again, i'd personally said to  ambassador volker and others that he shouldn't be talking to  mr. gi uli ani .  q\tand did you say that to mr. volker before that \tjuly th meeting?  a\tabsolutely.  q\twhat was mr. volker's response?  a\tagain, you know, getting back to what i said to  mr. castor, it was really about  he was try i ng to fix it.  i mean , he was tryi ng to refute, you know, the , kind of, very  negative perceptions that were coming out.  but i expressed to him that i was concerned that there      unclassified\t  were business dealings, nefarious business dealings,  underway.\tand i had mentioned to kurt volker the names of  these individuals that had been relayed to me.  the chairman:\ti just want to follow up with a couple of  questions about ambassador bolton's comments about not  wanting to be part of this drug deal.  did you understand it from that that he was not  referring to an actual drug deal but  dr. hill:\tof course not.\tyeah.  the chairman:\t some other kind of illicit transaction  that he believed that sondland and mulvaney were engaged in?  dr. hill:\tyes.\the made it clear that he believed that  they were maki ng, basically, an improper arrangement to have  a meeting in the whi te house, that they were predicating the  meeting in the white house on the ukrai ni ans agr eei ng, in  this case, based on the meeting on july th, to restart  investigations tha t had been dropped in the energy sector  the chairman:\tand  dr. hill:\tby which point it was apparent that this  was code, at least, for burisma.\tbecause that had been  mentioned, you know, in the course of mr. gi uli ani' s  appearances on television and i n the course of  i'd already  relayed to ambassador bolton everything that had been told to  me by everyone, including ambassador yovanovitch and phil  reeker, when amos hochstein had come in to see me, and i'd  unclassified\t  relayed to him everything i'd been told by our energy  directorate and by our western hemisphere directorate as  well.  the chairman:\tand not only was discussion of energy  code for burisma, but burisma was also, at this point,  understood to be code for the bidens , an investigation into  the bidens.  dr. hill:\tthat never came out explicitly, just to be  clear.  the chairman:\tand  ii\tdr. hill:\ti did   when i talked to ambassador bolton,  i also talked to charlie kupperman at length about this, the  deputy national security advisor.\ti mean, i recall telling  charlie that this was the company that hunter biden was  associated with.\tand we were concerned that  not at this  particular juncture, again, not specifically about the bidens  per se, but that ukraine was going to be played by giuliani  in some way as part of the campaign.  the chairman:\tnow  dr. hill:\tbecause it was positing, you know, here that  there was a great deal of, you know, illegal or whatever  activity going on in ukraine, according to giuliani.\tyou  know, basically, the  alternative theory of the election,  the cyber issues  these were all getting put out through  these articles in the newspaper.\tso it was kind of creating     unclassified\t  a kind of a story that was out there that was being packaged.  the chairman:\tnow, do you recall at the time   you  mentioned that giuliani had expressed that he was going to go  to ukraine.\tdo you remember when that was?  dr. hill:\tthat was almost immediately after ambassador  yovanovitch had been removed from office, so it was sometime  in may.\ti mean, again, i saw it on the television, he said  he was going to go.\tand then i heard it from colleagues.  and there was, you know, kind of, quite a bit of  consternation on the part of the state department.  the chairman:\tand he made it clear, i think, in those  television appearances, didn't he, that he was going to  ukraine to seek to have them i nvest i gate the bidens?  dr. hill:\twell, that's what he said.\tthat's what i  mean.\tthis is part of  i mean, i think, you know, part of  the dilemma that we all have here in trying to  you, me,  and all of us  parse this, is that a lot of this is  happening on the television, in terms of statements that  giuliani has made.  the chairman:\tdid that give content to you when you  heard these discussions going on, or did that inform  dr. hill:\tcorrect, i t did.\tand it was clearly\ti  mean, in ambassador bolton's office, when i was meeting with  him, the television was always on.\tand it was usually on fox  news.\ti mean, there was sometimes a split screen.\tand often  unclassified\t  when i was in the office, giuliani would be on the  television, and, you know, ambassador bolton would put on the  sound to hear what he was saying.  the chairman:\tso they di dn't need to make it explicit  in your presence what burisma meant.\tit was clear from rudy  giuliani's public comments that, for rudy giuliani, burisma  meant investigating the bidens.  dr. hill:\tcorrect.\tbut it was never explicitly said,  just to reiterate that.  the chairman:\tnot until the president's call with  president zelensky.  dr. hill:\tagain, which i only read about when the  transcript was released.    \tand   the chairman:\tbut you've seen that transcript now.   dr. hill:\ti have.\tbut i was not aware until that    point.  the chairman:\tand, in fact, in that transcript, the  president doesn't talk about burisma; he talks about  investigating the bidens.\tis that correct?  \tdr. hil l:\tfrom what i've read in the transcript.   the chairman:\tokay.  mr. goldman.   by mr. goldman:  q ambassador volker was also at that july th     unclassified\t  meeting, right?  a\the was.  q\tokay.\tso, to that point, had you gotten any  indication that the acting chief of staff, mick mulvaney, had  any discussions about a white house visit with ambassador  sondland or anyone else?  a\tyes, i had.  and just to be clear, that's also a part of, you know,  the acting chief of staff's role, is to oversee white house io\tvisits.\tit would be rath er unusual for him not to hav e been,  you know, consulted with on this.  i mean, you know, at this particular juncture, there was  a bit of tension on these visits overall.\tbut many  ambassadors  and i don't just mean our ambassadors, but,  you know, kind of, foreign ambassadors and foreign  officials\ti mean, were aware that ambassador bolton and  the national security staff would always do everything  according to national security provisions.  so there were a lot of meetings that  there were  requests, let's say, from heads of state that we actually  didn't think merited the presi dent's time, because they  weren't pertinent to, you know, basically, policy pri ori ti es.  and i don't want to be insulting to any particular  countries by, you know, singling any of them out, but let's  just say i think you would all, you know, agree that ther e's  unclassified\t  a certain hierarchy of countries that one would imagine that  the president should be making the most time for, and there  are orders that would be, you know, kind of a nice, you know,  diplomatic gesture, getting back to the questions before  about the letter , but that, you know, obviously wouldn't be  something that one would want to schedule at any particular,  you know, kind of fast pace.\tand these could be, you know,  heads of state that the president could have a greeting with  at a diplomatic reception at the unga and things like this.   q ii\ta  q  a  well, let me rephrase my question ­ no, so  oh.  the point is, on this, that mulvaney's office   had been pushed many, many times by ukrainians and others for  a visit.\tand so i was wellaware that ambassador sondland  was talking to the chief of staff at the moment.  and ambassador sondland was, frankly, trying to play us  off the na ti onal security council and ambassador bolton  against mulvaney's office.\tbecause we were saying that we  didn't actually believe, at that particular juncture, that we  should have a meeting with zelensky.\tbecause we wanted to  wait until the july  by this point, you know, i can't  remember exactly, you know  and forgive me  when it was  announced that the ukraine elections would be july st.  because there was some question about whether it would be a      unclassified\t  snap election.\tthe actual election time might have been in  the fall.\tyou know, it could've been in october or, you  know, some other date.  and so we were waiting to see when the election would  be.\tand we were pushing back against this, you know, kind  of, idea that zelensky needed to have a meeting right away.  we were saying, you know, getting back to our earlier  discussion, no, we should wait to see if he actually has a  majority.\ti mean, what if he  and we didn't also want to  then be seen to be playing in the ukrainian parliamentary ii\telecti ons.\tbecause, obviously, a white house visit for  zelensky before the rada elections, the parliamentary  elections, would be a big boost, potentially, to his ability  to get a workable or a majority mandate.\tso we were trying  to be very careful .  and ambassador bolton knows ukraine very well.\ti mean,  you've seen, you know, he did his independent visits there.  when he was outside of government, he was frequently in  ukraine.\the knew all the players.\the knows how complicated  the politics and things are there.\tand he was trying to, you  know, basically restrain others for pushing for a meeti ng  that he thought would be premature.  q\tprior to that july th meeting, were you aware of  mr. mulvaney being involved in any conversations about a  white house visit being contingent on opening i nvest i gati ons?  unclassified\t  a\ti was not.  q\tso that was the first   a\tthat was right.  q\t that you had heard of it?  a\tbut i knew that he was obviously a player already  in decisions about having a visit.   q\tokay.  a\tand i was  to be honest, i was qu i te shocked.\ti  mean, prior to that, the only other indication that i had  that ambassador sondland and the chief of staff were, you ii\tknow, kind of talking about this, you know, directly was the  letter, getting back to the paragraph that we discussed  earlier, where ambassador sondland essentially, you know,  told us that he had, you know, personally made sure that this  letter was released and that  because it was delayed, you  know, somewhat, it wasn't im med i ately out after the election.  the election happened over a weekend, and, you know, it was  taking a while for the results to get i n, but it was, you  know, getting snarled up.\tand sondland said that he would  make sure that the letter got out.\tand he said that he was  the person who put i n this paragraph about having the white  house visit.  so that's in the week of april ndrd, if the st  was a sunday.\tso that week immediately after the april st  presidential electi on.     unclassified\t  q\tyou're referring to the phone call?  a\tno, about the letter that was basically stating  that there would be a general invitation for a white house  visit.   q  a  then.  i think the letter was may th. was it may th?\tso there was a considerable delay   q\tso it was after the  you may recall, just to  refresh your recollect i on, that the inauguration in ukraine  was may th.  a\tright.\tokay.\tso it was around the i naugurat ion.  i' m sorry then.\ti was getting my dates mixed up.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tso it was after , then, the inauguration for a  congratulatory letter.  q\tright.  a\tso that makes sense.\ti'm sorry, because i'm  getting my timelines confused here.\tbecause the election  happened; there was a congratulatory phone call, which we,  you know, kind of, prepared just to say, hey,  congratulations, that was great.\tand then the re was an idea  then there would be a letter that would be tied to the  inauguration.\tand there was a lot of backandforth on when  that would be as well.  but that was on the ukrainian part .\tbecause the  unclassified\t  ukrainians, themselves, were not sure when to have the  inauguration, because, again, they were trying to determine  when they would call parliamentary rada elections.  i'm sorry.\ti got the timeframes confused.  q\tno, that's fine.  just while we're on the topic of the april st call,  did you listen in to that call?  a\ti did not.\tit was on a weekend, and i remember i  was doing something with my \t· and alex vindman, our  director, agreed to go in.   q   a  and listen in? yeah.\tand it was a very short call.   q\tdid you read the transcript?  a\ti think i'm not   mr. wolosky:\tyeah, i think that would probably be  classified, the april st call.  by mr. goldman:  q\ti just want to know if you read the transcript  afterwards.   a  q   a  q  i di d. okay. i said it was a short congratulatory call. all right.   so, just getting back to this, sort of, aftermath of \tjuly th, you said you were surprised, and ambassador bolton      unclassified\t asked you to go meet with john eisenberg.\tdid you go meet  with  a\ti did.  q\t mr. eisenberg?  a\tyeah.  q\twhen did you do that?  a\ti ended up meeting with him on the next day.\ti  went over immediately and talked to him, you know, very  briefly, and we agreed that we would have a longer discussion  the following day, where i would talk to him about all of the ii\tconcerns that i had about what was going on on the ukraine  front.  q\tand in that initial brief conversation, do you  recall what you said and what he said?  a\tyeah.\ti told him exactly, you know, what had  transpired and that ambassador sondland had basically  indicated that there was an agreement with the chief of staff  that they would have a white house meeting or, you know, a  presidential meeting if the ukrainians started up these  investigations again.\tand the main thing that i was  personally concerned about, as i said to john, was that he  did this in front of the ukra i ni ans.  q\twhy were you concerned about that in parti cular?  a\twell, i mean, this is  you know, we're talking  here about, you know, should one reveal deliberative process  unclassified\t  to, you know, kind of, people outside of the government?\tand  here we're having a deliberative process.\ti mean, this is  what ambassador bolton was pretty livid about, you know, kind  of in an argument between, you know, our ambassador to the eu  and our national security advisor about having a meeti ng, you  know, in front of the national security advisordesignate of  uk rain e and the chief advisor, mr. yermak, to the ukrainian  president and a whole bunch of extran eous, you know, kind of,  people who hadn't, actually, also been in that meeting on  ju ly th.  q\tthe  a\tand, again, the ukrainians were put outside of the  ward room when i pointed out that this wasn't an appropriate  place to be having a discussion about what was going to be a  deliberative process about how one goes about setting up a  meeting and the ti ming of i t and the content of it.\tand then  they're standing there i n, you know, basically the space in  the corridor between the navy mess and the white house sit  room.  q\tand why were you concerned about that specific  locat i on?  a\twell, because an awful lot of people were going in  the sit room and are having, you know, deli berati ve  conver sati ons that may or may not be classi fi ed on their way  into there.     unclassifi ed\t  and there's a sign in the navy mess that says, you know,  do not have classified, you know, conversations in here  because, you know, external people may be present.\tbut on  the way to the sit room  i don't know if you've been in the  space.\tit's about the space of, kind of, the interior here  of these desks.\tso you have a couple of ukrainians who were  standing there as cabinet members or anybody else could be  going into the sit room, which will already give them  i nformat i on about meetings that could be taking place there.  i mean, they shouldn't have been, you know, kind of, ii\tbasically out in the corridor.  but, also, that meeting in the ward room would've  been\tunder normal circumstances, we would've known about  it.\twe didn't know that they were actually having a meeting  in the ward room.\tand it's completely inappropriate to have,  you know, the ambassador to the eu take the ukrainians down  to the ward room to have a huddle on next steps about getting  a meeting with the president of the united states.  q\tyou had said earlier that  a\tnow, secretary perry, again, i want to say, had  left by the time i got down there.\the had clearly gone down  and then had left.\tso this is ambassador sondland and  ambassador volker there.  q\tand you had said earlier that you were concerned  that ambassador sondland was a counterintelligence risk.\tis  unclassified\t  this an example of that concern?  a\twell, yes.\tand a risk not by intent, getting back  to mr. castor's question about, you know, ambassador  sondland 's integrity, but one about just more about being  clueless sometimes about the kinds of natures of threats.  and that's something  ambassadors get all kinds of,  you know, early counterintelligence briefings.\tbut, you  know, he has now expanded his remit, you know, to countries  that, you know, in the case of ukraine, are targeted by the j o\trussians.\tone could be sure that  you know, i didn't even ji\tknow whether the ukrainians had left their cell phones in  boxes at this particular point.\ti mean, they had when they  were in ambassador bolton's offi ce, but had they picked them  up before they went down to the ward room?\ti di dn 't know any  of this.  and so, i mean, all of them   and you can be sure that  they're being targeted by the russians, if not, you know,  kind of, members of our own cabinet and our own team.\tand as  ambassador sondland was using his own personal cell phone at  all times, as well as his governm enti ssued cell phone, i  became extremely concerned that his communications were not  going to be secure.    q for example, the whatsapp text messages that you've  now      a yeah, we were not allowed  just to be, again,     unclassified\t  clear, the white house has disabled all of those functions on  the phone.\tand ambassador sandland was always trying to  text.\tand on my white house phone, which did not receive  texts, i would always get th i s kind of ghost text from  ambassador sandland, from the very fir st time i met him,  texting me to say that he wanted to meet, from his personal  cell phone.\tand every time i switched the phone on, this  ghost text would appear.\tjust to make the poi nt.  but he was the only person, you know, who tried that.  we kept telling him over and over again, please do not text ii\t\tus.\tand the same thi ng with whatsapp; we were not allowed to  use this because of the presi denti al record and presidential  communications.  the chairman :\ti just want to go back to that first  short discuss i on you had with attor ney eisenberg.  dr. hill:\tyes.  the chairman:\ti think you conveyed that you described  briefly your concern over having this debate about setting up  this meeting in front of the ukraine delegation.\tyou  expressed your concer n about the secur i ty issues involved  with having this discussion, where it was taking place.  did you also discuss with attorney eisenberg, though,  ambassador bolton's concern that there was an illicit  tran sacti on here?  dr. hill:\ti di d.\tand i said tha t, actually, what i  unclassified\t  would like would be for him to also ask my counterpart, wells  griffith, to talk to him too, who'd been in the meeting.  because i couldn't really determine, at the time, initially,  in the meeting with ambassador bolton, exactly what it was  that ambassador sandland had said that tri ggered off  ambassador bolton's reaction.  because secretary perry had been sticking to the regular  talking points about energy that we always had , you know,  that were obviously referring to naftogaz and, you know, to io\tthe energy sector writ large, which was, frankly, rife with ii\tcorruption.  and, you know, you may all recall, you know, under  previous iterations of the ukrainian government, there was  the notorious dmytro firtashrun organization or intermediary  gas enti ty, rosukrenergo  and i'm sure you had lots of  congressional hearings, you know, about this  that was  really basically an interface for all kinds of illicit  dealings between the russians and the ukrainians.  so we've been on this issue for decades, frankly. i  mean, i was working on this with the bush administration and  the obama administration. everybody has gone through looking  at this issue. so when secretary perry was talking, i mean,  from my perspective, it's just following in a long line of  all of the issues that we said.  and then when ambassador sandland came in about specific  unclassified\t  investigations, that's when ambassador bolton stiffened up  and immediately, you know, brought the meeting to a halt ,  because he tied that to the meeting.\tbut when i went down  mr. goldman:\tsorry.\tyou mean the white house meeting?  dr. hill:\tto the white house meeting or to a meeting  with the president.\tnow, just to be, kind of, clear,  actually, it wasn' t always a white house meeting per se, but  definitely a presidentiallevel, you know, meeting with  zelensky and the president.\ti mean, it could've taken place  in poland, in warsaw.\tit could've been, you know, a proper ii\tbilateral in some other context.\tbut, in other words, a  white houselevel presidential meeting.  the chairman:\tso then you were saying  and then you  went downstairs.  dr. hill:\tand then i went downstairs.\tand i came in  when the conversation was already underway, because i had  talked to ambassador bolton quickly to, you know, kind of,  get a bit more of a sense of, you know, kind of, his concerns  and what he wanted me to be watchful for.\ti mean, i had my  own concerns.  as i said, wh n i was coming i n, secretary perry was  leaving.\tso i'm not sure that secretary perry was there for  this portion of the discussion.\tand wells griffith had  already  had also left as well.  by mr. goldman:  unclassified\t  q\twas ambassador volker sti ll there for this?  a\tambassador volker was still there, and yermak and  danylyuk and, as i mentioned before, a couple of state  department people and somebody who i thought could've been  one of secretary perry's aides but i'm not  percent sure.  because secretary perry had a large\tbecause he was off to  go to do some other business and he had a large group of  people with hi m.  and i t was at that point that sandland was complai ni ng  to our director, alex vindman, about the fact that he already i i\thad an arrangement to have this meeting that he worked out  with mulvaney.  the chairma n:\tand so i want to get back to your  conveying this to the attorney, eisenberg.  dr. hill:\tyeah.  the chairma n:\twhat did you convey to him at tha t first  short meeting?\tand then mr. goldman wi ll get i nto what you  conveyed to him in the longer meeti ng.\tbut in the first  meeti ng, what did you convey to him about any concern you had  over this i lli ci t transaction, the if that you mentioned?  dr. hill:\tyeah, i explai ned to hi m what i just  explai ned to you.\tand then i sai d, but i need to actually  talk to wells griffith and we should talk to wells about what  he understood was the larger context here as well.  because sandland talked about bur i sma when i was with     unclass ified\t  him in the ward room, but i didn't hear him say burisma when  i was in ambassador bolton's office.\tand, again, i was  sitting at the back, on the sofa.\tthey were all, you know  i was behind sondland, and he was talk i ng forward.\tso i  wasn't sure if i missed it or whether he d i dn' t say it at  all.   and i also wanted to be clear  sort of interrupt bolton and perry  because he seemed to you know, what it was  i  that wells understood that secretary perry was talking about. io\tbecause this gets to the nub of what we're concerned about. ii was this a generic d i scussi on about, you know, corruption in  the energy sector and ukraine, or was it something much more  specific?\tand i wanted to make sure that wells griffith   could also talk to eisenberg. and that's why we had the  larg er meeting the next day.                                           unclassified\t    the chairma n:\tand did you  the larg er meeting with  eisenberg?  dr. hill:\tjust me and eisenberg and wells griffith.\ti  mean meeting, meaning to bring in wells, and so that i could  get into more detail, and i could go through my notes and,  you know, kind of basi cally figure out, you know, what  exactly had happened.  the chairman:\tdo you want to walk through that meeting? jo\tby mr. goldman:   q  a   q  a   q  a  yeah.\tso in that meeting on july , wells ­ wells also came i n. what's his last name? wells griffith. gr i ffi th. it's p. wells griffith.\tand he is a longterm,    he's a really, you know, superb energy expert, works very  closely with secretary perry.   q  a  q  a  and it was the three of you? yes, it was the three of us. all right.\tand so describe that conversation. well, i reiterated to john the day before, and, you   know, i apologized to wells for, you know, jumping on him,  but i said that i wanted to, you know, basi cally just to  clarify for john, you know , what had  i told him what had      unclassified\t  happened in the ward room, but i wasn't enti rely sure, you  know, what wells also thought had happened in ambassador  sondland' s offi ce, because it was i mmed i ately after secretary  perry had gone through his talki ng points.  and wells and the deputy  the deputies to secretary  perry had worked on those talking poi nts. and i wanted to  just kind of be certain,  percent sure that secretary  perry's talki ng points were exactly what i anticipated or  thought that they were, which is about the generic, you know,  problems of the energy sector, which i s what  i i\tmr. wolosky:\tyou said ambassador sondland's office.\ti  think you meant ambassador bolton's office.  dr. hil l:\toh, did i?\ti'm so sorr y.\tyeah.\tthank you  for correcting me.\tyeah, when ambassador sandland was in  ambassador bolton's office.  by mr. goldman:  q\tand just to be clear, between meetings wi th  mr. eisenberg, did you have any followon conversati ons with  ambassador bolton?  a\ti did not, no, not in tha t time.  q\tdid you talk to anybody else about this meeting?  a\ti talked to wells grif fi th.\tand then i also had  my colleague alex vindman was really upset, because he said  that before i came in sandland was making it very clear that  there was all kinds of  that there was  and perry had  unclassified\t      ,., .)                 · ,\t            left at this point.\the said perry didn't need to stay, because by the time i came into the ward room alex vindman was very up upset. q\tand what did mr. vindman say?      a\the said that these are obviously not issues that the national security council was dealing with, should not deal with.\t\tand he actually said this along the lines to ambassador sandland, that whatever it was that he was talking about was not appropriate for us to be engaged in, and that we were  you know, could only, you know, be organizing a meeting, you know, as the national security council on, you know, official national security basis, and clearly something else was going on her e. q\tso at this meeting on the th with mr. eisenberg and mr . griffith, what did mr. griffith relay to mr. eisenberg about his recollection of this meeting?       a\t\this recollection was somewhat similar that, you know\tand he confirmed that secretary perry's talking points were all the usual talking points about energy sector corrupti on, the importance of getting the energy sector into good shape and diversification of energy, all of the issues that we were trying to do.      we were trying to get the ukrainians to work with the czechs, the poles, and with the europeans more broadly , the germans, you know.\tsecretary perry had been going to the      unclassified\t  three seas initiative, which is all about building up  i nfrast ructur e in eastern europe.  so secretary perry was, you know, very much focused on a  whole larger initiative spearheaded by doe but also with the  state department on trying to help ukraine wean itself off  this dependency.\tso everything that wells believed that  secretary perry was saying was related to that .  we also agreed that sondland seemed to be redirecting it  into  q\twhat was his recollection of what ambassador ii sondland said in the ward room?   a   q  a  in the ward room he wasn't i n. oh, so this was just in the main meeting. wells was also confirming, though, that secretary   perry was not in on this discussion in the ward room, that  he'd come down briefly.\tand that was also important to me  because i needed to know did secretary perry, you know, have  part of this discussion as well.  q\tso it was you personally who heard ambassador  sondland mention burisma  a\tcorrect.  q\t in the ward room?  a\tcorrect.\tand wells had been sitting with me in  ambassador bolton's office when the initial meeting took  place, and he also understood it was a redirect.  unclassified\t   q\tand mr. vindman was also there ­  a\tcorrect.  q\t and heard it?  a\tand kurt volker.  the chairman:\tcan you tell us what  you said  mr. vindman expressed concern about what took place, and he  was there before you got to the ward room.  dr. hill:\tyes.  the chairman:\tcan you tell us what mr. vindman told  you  dr. hill:\the was really uncomfortable with where the  conversation was, and that's also because it was in front of  ukrainians, that it was bas i cally ambassador sondland getting  very annoyed that he already had an agreement with the chief  of staff for a meeting between the presi dent s on the basis of  these investigations.  the chairman:\tand did he know anything more about the  inv esti gati ons?  dr. hil l:\the was alarmed, mr. vindman, because he  didn't know exactly what was going on.\tand he said that  and as i said, sondland had mentioned meeting with giuliani  in front of, again, the ukrainians.\tand   mr. goldman:\tso what  dr. hill:\twho was the national security advisor   mr. goldman:\t did he say about that?     unclassi fied\t  dr. hill:\ti didn't get exactly what the wording was.  the chairman:\tbut mr. sondland brought up mr. giuliani  in the context of there being this agreement on the meeting.  dr. hill:\tand that he said he'd been meeting with  giuliani as well.\tthis is at least what i understood, you  know, from alex.  the chairman:\tthat was what mr. vindman relayed?  dr. hill:\tthat's what he understood, yes.  the chairman:\tand did giuliani 's name come up when you  were in the ward room?  dr. hill:\tno.  by mr. goldman:  q\tcan you just clarify why it was important to you to  understand that secretary perry's talking points were  separate and apart from the reference to investigations by  ambassador sondland?  a\tit was important to me because i was trying to  figure out how much ambassador sondland was coordinating with  others.\tand, again, we'd actually tried to prioritize in  this timeframe energy sector reform and all of the work with  the other european countries.\tso i was pretty concerned here  in thinking that maybe ambassador sondland was not keeping  secretary perry fully informed of what was going on either.  q\tand so   a\tand i'd understood from the may inauguration, i was  unclassified\t  not in the meeting that relayed back to the president about  how the inauguration had gone, but i understood from the  readout there that we were to focus on energy sector reform  as a top priority, and that secretary perry had been asked to  sort of step up and to really see what he could do to, you  know, work with the ukrainian s in this timeframe to prove  that they could actually start to tackle, you know,  corruption in ukraine.  and so by this point i'm personally concerned that  there's something else going on, and i wanted to make sure ii\tthat i understand who it's going on between.  q\tso the energy sector reform and the anticorruption  efforts surrounding that were what secretary perry was  talking about?   a  q  correct. and is it  was it your understanding that   ambassador sondland was not talking about that     a  q  a  \tq  a  correct.  when he mentioned  and it's the way that he did a redirect. and what do you mean by redi rect? well, secretary perry was talking, and then, you   know, he la i d out all of these talking points.\tand then  ambassador bolton said  you know, was basically saying  well , you know, we'll work all the way through all of this,  .      unclassified\t  you know, kind of a rule, you know.\tat some point start, you  know, thinking, you know, basically about a meeting, but, you  know, we're going to be, you know, in the process of  and  it was encouraging actually what you're talking about, which  was all the staffing work and the different parts of the  agencies, state department.\the was urging the ukrainians to  deal with the state department and to deal with secretary  perry.  and this is when sandland, who is, you know, a fairly  big guy, kind of leaned over across ambassador bolton, ii\tbecause i could see that from where i was sitting, and said  to the ukrainians and back to ambassador bolton, but we've  already got, you know, kind of an agreement on a meeting.  i mean, he was basically  and you can imagine, you  would all be annoyed as well that he was basically  countermanding what ambassador bolton had just said.\tin  other words saying, i actually have, you know, some  completely separate agreement about a meeting, you know, kind  of you're stonewalling kind of thing.  and then he was clearly in the  when he went out into  the office in front of ambassador bolton he was kind of  clearl y , you know, feeling irritated, sandland was.\tand  that's when he said, let's go back down to the ward room and  talk about next steps for the meeting.\tand that's when  bolton was just, you know, i wouldn't say apoplectic, but  unclassified\t  pretty furious.  q\twho did sandland say that to?  a\the said it to the ukrainians.  q\twas it your understanding that he had previously   discussed  a\ti took it from that that he'd already said to the  ukrainians that there was going to be a meeting and that  obviously he was expecting ambassador bolton to start. you  know, pulling out the schedule, which is not what ambassador  bolton does anyway.\tthat's worked out through the chief of  staff's office and the visit.  q\tand just so the record is clear, when you say  meeting, you mean a presidential meeting?  a\ta presidentiallevel meeting, again, be it the  white house, be it in warsaw, be it, you know, kind of in any  of the places it would be.  and we had been again, as i' ve said repeatedly,  ambassador bolton and others, recommending against having a  meeting at this juncture because this is, you know, before  the ukrainian parliamentary elections.  q\twas it your impression that the ukrainian officials  there were hearing this idea of a presidential meeting  conditioned on these investigations for the first time at  that meeting   a\tdanylyuk for sure.\the just looked alarmed, and      unclassif ied\t  actually he wanted to speak to me afterwards because he  obviously didn't know what was going on.  q\tand what about yermak?  a\tyermak was more impassive, but i'm not entirely  sure that he fully understood everything because i'm not  convinced about how good his english is.\tso i just want to  state that for the record, that i wasn't entirely clear that  yermak was understanding everything because he didn't really  say too much.\tand he had an aide with him who was whispering  to him, and, again, i was sitting at a distance, and he maybe  had been helping him with trans la ti on.  q\tdid you end up speaking to danylyuk about   a\ti did, but we actually di dn't really discuss what  had actually happened  well, i di dn't want to discuss what  had happened obviously in the ward room.  what i was trying to encourage danylyuk was to work with  the state department, work with our embassy, and, you know,  particularly as he was interested in working on the na ti onal  security council reform in ukraine.  i really wanted to get, you know, danylyuk into the  channels that we all, you know, kind of knew were working on  getting back to this robust relationship.\tdanylyuk was a,  you know, very aboveboard guy, one of the refor mers in  ukraine.\tactually, he resigned his posi ti on in ukraine  recently.  unclassified\t  q\twas it your understanding from any of the  interactions you had with him or any i nformati on you got that  danylyuk was aware of rudy giuliani 's efforts separate and  apart from the official   a\the didn't raise it.\the was just generally  concerned about actually not having a meeting because he felt  that this would deprive ukraine, the new ukrainian government  of the legitimacy that it needed , especially visavis the  russians.\tso this gets to, you know, the heart of our  nat i onal security dilemma. ii\tyou know, the ukrainians at this point, you know, are  looking at a white house meeting or looki ng at a meeting with  the presi de nt of the united states as a recognition of thei r  legitimacy as a sovereign state.\tand they are, you know,  clearly perplexed , you know, kind of about this whole  situation surrounding the meeting.  q\twhat was\tjust because we're somewhat short on  ti me, i'm going to jump to the crux of this july th  meeti ng.\twhat was mr. eisenberg's reacti on to what you  explai ned to him had and mr. gr i ffi th had explai ned to him  had occurred the day before?  a\tyeah.\the was also concern ed.\ti mean, he wasn't  awa re that sondland, ambassador sondland was, you know, kind  of running around doing a lot of these, you know, meetings  and independently.\twe talked about the fact that , you know,     unclassified\t  ambassador sondland said he'd been meeting with giuliani and  he was very concerned about that.\tand he said that he would  follow up on this.  he has frequen t meetings with ambassador bolton and had  frequent meetings with ambassador bolton and also with  charlie kupperman, our deputy national security advisor, both  of whom, you know, were fully cognizant of everything that  was kind of going on and churning around.  i'd already expressed concern s to all of them about the  removal of masha yovanovi tch.\ti mean, i'd gone to talk all i\tthe way up my chain expressing my concerns and, you know,  basically anger that this had happened.  i'd also talked to the vice president's staff, to  general kellogg, who was the person who'd hired me and who,  you know, i'd previously reported to in the first year of the  administration, about these concerns as well, flagging for  him that there were problems and that we should   q\tsorry, just to be clear, you mentioned ambassador  yovanovitch.\twhat are these concerns?  a\tthat she had been unfairly dismissed, that she'd  been forced out as a result of all of these conspiracy  theories and these attacks on her.  q\tdid you speak to them as well about  mr. giuliani's   a\ti did.  unclassified\t  q\tefforts and influence?  a\tbecause this was all in the news, and, i mean, you  know, again, everyone was watching the news and seeing this.  and i said that this was, you know, a massive complication in  terms of our engagements with ukraine, because we were also  talking about the vice presi dent having engaged with the  ukrainian leader if we could not schedule a meeting with the  president, and that's simply about scheduling.  because, you know, traditionally the vice president has  played an important role on countries like ukraine or georgia  or a whole host of issues.\tand the vice president had on his  itinerary a range of foreign trips, including the trip you  saw that he took recently , a personal trip to ireland.  and we were trying to talk to his staff about whether it  would make sense for the vice president to maybe go via kyiv  or, you know, kind of basically meet with president zelensky  if we could not schedule a presidential meeti ng in due  course , you know, within a reasonable period of time after  the parl i amentary elections.  q\tafter   a\tand also, by the way, september st we knew was  coming up because the president had been invited to  commemorate the i ni ti ati on of world war ii.  q\tthere wasn't a long period of time when you were  still there after this july th meeting, but at any point  unclassif ied\t  before july th did you hear back either from mr. eisenberg  directly or from ambassador bolton or anyone else about any  further conversations that mr. eisenberg had on this topic?  a\tnot from ambassador bolton, i did not.\tjohn  eisenberg said that he had followed up, and he had followed  up, you know, through his basically reporting authority,  which would be the white house counsel.  q\tbut did   and you didn't hear anything else    a\ti did not, no.  q\t  on your side of the   i i\ta\tno, i did not.  q\tdo you know whether mr. eisenberg spoke to  mr. sondland at all?  a\twell, that wouldn't be, i thi nk, appropriate in his  position.  q\twho would be the proper person to speak to  mr. sondland and tell him to, you know, change his course of  action?   a   q  it would be the state department. and did you hear whether the state department   did that?  a\twell, i talked to assistant secretary reeker about  this, and i also flagged it, you know, again, as i'd  mentioned before, at different points, actually probably not  after the july th discussion.\tbut i'd also at different  unclassified\t  points talked to under secretary hale about the concerns  about ambassador sandland, well, obviously, going in a  direction we were hoping he wouldn't on the ukrainian issue.  q\tand was there a substantive response from under  secretary hale or mr. reeker?  a\ti mean, they were aware of it.\tand, you know, my  presumption was based on the fact that they're both, you  know, stellar professionals that they would follow up on this  in some way.  q\taround this time in midjuly , we understand that ii there was an order to hold on the security assistance  intended for ukraine.    a   q  a  right. when did you learn about that? i learned about it in that week, that is my last    week there.  q\tand how did you learn?  a\ti learned about it just in the normal course of  action.\twe were informed that there had been a hold on the  by the  from mb.  q\twere you informed as to the reason why?  a\tno, there was no reason given.\tand we were told  that it actually came as a direction from the chief of  staff's office.  q\tfrom mr. mulvaney?      unclassified\t    \tomb?      a\twho, i think  is he still technically the head of   q\tyes.\the hasn't left, yes. a\tso there you are then.\tyeah.\ti mean, tha t's   i   mean, he had three different hats then, i guess, and i think  it came under his  it would have been, you know, i guess,  normal for him to have put the hold on.  q\tas of that july th meeting, do you know whether  ambassador bolton or anyone else was aware of whether this  military aid or security assistance had been put on hold?  a\ti don't think they knew.\tit had not been  discussed.\tit was in the last week that i was there.  q\tokay.\tand did you have any conversations yourself  about the hold   a\twe did.  q\twithin your reporting structure?  a\tand, in fact, there was a meeting set up, two  meetings on ukraine in the last week that i was there, but  ti m morrison went and chaired them, so i did not take part in  these meetings.  so there was  interagency meetings were basi cally  called to find out what was going on.\tand charlie kupperman,  the deputy ass i stant to the president, the national security  advi sor, was basically trying to get to the bottom of it.  q\tand did you ever learn wha t he found out?  unclassified\t  a\ti did not, but i know that he was going to go and  talk to mulvaney about this.  and i left on the th, so, you know, by that point  but i relayed to ambassador taylor at that point most of the  things i've actually relayed to you today.  q\tso let's just talk about ambassador taylor for our  last couple minutes.\the had become the charge d'affair es in  ukraine?  a\tcorrect.  q\tand you spoke to him you said, i think, on i i\tju ly th?  a\tyes, but i'd actually spoken to him on several  occasions before.\ti think you're all familiar with  ambassador taylor's biography.\ti've worked wi th hi m in many,  many di fferent capacities.  and he was asked after ambassador yovanovi tch was  removed along wi th a number of other people whether they  would be wi lli ng to be charge, because it was agreed that  with her precipitous removal  i mean, she'd initially been,  it was my understanding because i'd been told that by the  state department, asked to stay on for a transitional period  a bi t longer than she was supposed to, you know, as the  zelensky presidency was underway.  so it was pretty abrupt, notwithstanding all the  information we now have about this.\tso there was a debate     unclassified\t  about how\tcould you possibly still have the embassy there  with, you know, no charge of any stature .  and there was a new dcm being sent out, kristina kvien,  who i met in that last week as well, who was just being sent  out fresh, although she was very knowledgeable about the  region.  and there was a debate back and forth about whether they  could find someone from ei ther previous ambassadors to  ukraine or someone from high level, like a paula dobriansky,  you know, the ukrainian american community, or somebody who  would be willing to be charge at this transi tional period to  basically  again, getting back to the national security  questions about showing to ukraine that we were still  supportive of them and that we were still standing by them in  the face of russian aggression  to have someone of stature  there until there could be a formal appointment and naming of  a new ambassador.  q\tand ambassador taylor was someone of stature in  your view?  a\tcorrect.\tyes.\ti mean, he'd previ ously been  ambassador to ukraine and is one of the most distinguished,  you know, people that one can think of.  q\ti believe you said, and i just want to clarify  this, that ambassador taylor, you relayed i think you called  them red flags   unclassified\t  a\tmy red flags.  q\tyour red flags to ambassador taylor, and that he  was unaware that ambassador sondland had taken lead on  ukrainian policy.\tis that   a\tcorr ect.\tthat was news to him.\ti mean, he, like  everybody else, knew that ambassador sondland was playing a  role, but he had not been told that ambassador sondland was  the lead.   q  a  q  and he had not been told by the state department? no. nor by ambassador sondland?    a\tno.  q\tokay.\tall right.\ti believe our time is up, so i  yield to the min ori ty for  minutes.  by mr. castor:  q\tis it fair to say just about every special envoy or  broadly chartered ambassador sometimes is blamed for jumping  out of their lane?  a\tyes, but ambassador sondland hadn ' t been named as a  special envoy or, you know, ambassador at that time.\twe had  ambassador volker who had been named as the special envoy for  ukraine, but ambassador sondland was saying that he was in  charge of ukrainian affairs writ large.  q\tare we certa i n the presi dent never appointed  ambassador sondland to this role?  unclassif ied\t a\tno.  q\tor we only know about  a\tas i said before, you remember, when i said, i said  what?\twho?\tyou know, who said this?\tand he said the  president, and then, you know, i couldn' t really argue with  that.  q\tin the july th meeting in the fallout in the ward  room, was it ever clear to you what investigations were part  of this discussion?  a\twell, he mentioned buri sma.  q\tburisma.\tanything else?  a\tno.  q\tokay.  a\tand again, i cut it off because it was obviously  going down avenues which were not appropriate for the  national security council to go down.\tand also, again, he's  haggling almost about this meeting.  q\tare you aware of the allegation   there's been  some reporti ng, there was a big politico article in  ja nuary   about ukrai ni ans' efforts to affect the  outcome of the election, the u.s. election?    a   q  i'm aware of the articles. and do you give any credibility to some of the   basic charges in there, such as\t\tare you  familiar with that?\twould it be helpful if we marked this as  unclassified\t  an exhibit, this politico article?  a\ti' ve seen that politico article.  q\tokay.  a\tlook, i think we have  q\ti can hand i t to you.  a\tno.\tbut we have  q\tdo you want it?  a\tand i am very confident based on all of the  analysis that has been done  and, again, i don't want to jo\tstart getting into intelligence matters  that the ukrainian ii government did not interfere in our election in .   q  a  okay.\tbut you're aware of the reporting? i' m aware of the reporting, but that doesn' t mean   that that amounts to an operation by the ukrainian  government.   q  a  right.\twhat do you know about  ? i don't know very much about them, apart from    things that i couldn't speak about.  can i also say that in my past life at brookings, is a  think tank, i must have had about  different people from  all kinds of different backgrounds coming to try to use me as  a conduit to various campaigns, republican and democrat,  given my experience and links, from, you know, ukrainian,  belarussian, you know, georgian, russian, all try i ng to make  contact with the campaigns.      unclassified\t  i could write a million articles like that putting all  kinds of people's names out there based on just the contacts  of people that i had.  q\tfair enough.\tjust asking the questions.  a\tno, but i'm just saying in here that  but this  gets back to what masha yovanovitch said, that you can write  something in an article and it somehow becomes true that it's  written in an article without all of the due diligence that's  done about\tdone on this later.  i have my own beef with  and the investigations, ii\tthat i don' t believe it should have started by focusing,  first of all, on americans.\tit should have started by  looking at what russians were doing, and i think we would  have ended up in exactly the same place that mr. mueller did  on what the russians did with the same sets of indictments,  and it might have not been quite so politicized at the time,  because i can promise you that the russians did everything  that he outlined and then some.\tand i myself have been  targeted by the russians on many occasions.  and that doesn' t make me antirussian.\tbut i'll just  say that this particular russian administration, run by  somebody who is an incredibly, you know, wellskilled kgb  operative, is something that you just don't mess with.\tand  we are going to be in big trouble   q\twho is the kgb operative?  unclassified\t  a\tthat's president puti n.  and we're going to be in big trouble, if we don't get  our act together, in creating more fodder for them to throw  right back at us in .\tand i think this is an issue of  our national security for all of us, no matter what part of  the aisle that you're sitting on.  q\twould you agree though that, you know, the bringing  of mr. manafort's dealings in the ukraine to the forefront,  you know, may have had   a\tcorruption is the way that president putin and ii\tother nefarious actors, be they from china, iran, or north  korea, access our system.  q\tare you familiar with the, you know, the allegation  about serhiy leshchenko?\ti'm sorry if i'm not pronouncing  that  a\tleshchenko, yes.  q\tyou know, relating to publicizing manafort's role  in the ukraine?  a\tyou've also got to remember that ukraine is goi ng  through a massive period of upheaval itself in this period.  i mean, this is the period where yanukovych, the previous  ukrainian presi dent , basically flees the country, leaves all  kinds of documents and things behind, and the ukrainian  investigative reporters and everybody poring all over thi s.  you can go back and look on youtube at some of the  unclassified\t  rather strange things that yanukovych left behind him.\the  tried to flush half of his documents down the toilet.\the  threw some of those in a lake.\tthere was all kinds of  material that were out there for people to pick over and to  look at.\tand i think, again, that mr. mueller and his team  have well documented a lot of this information.  q\tbut to the extent the ukrainians were involved in  pushing out the information on paul manafort, don't you think  that could have had an impact on the election?  a\tther e are all kinds of things that could have had ii\tan i mpact on our election.  q\tdo you think it's fair that people who are aware of  that reporting   a\ti don't know how much the average american voter is  aware of that reporting.\tmy fami ly\t, my  inlaws, that was not the reason that they voted in the  election, fo r example.\ti have a huge american family, and  none of them have ever referenced anything like that to me at  all.\tthey just  they care about all the thi ngs that the  average american cares about, which is health, education,  jobs.  q\tbut i f there are ukrainians trying to push the  information out about manafort, isn't that an effort to  i nfluence the outcome of the election?  mr. wolosky:\ti think she answered the question several  unclassified\t  tim es.  dr. hill:\talso there are ukrainians pushing out  mr. castor:\tit's a pretty harmless question.  mr. wolosky:\tyou' ve asked it three or four times.  dr. hill:\tyes, but there are ukrainians pushing out  information about masha yovanovitch which is untrue.\twhy  don't you ask about that as well?\tis masha yovanovitch any  less of an american that mr. manafort?\tshe has not been  accused of any corruption.  mr. zeldin:\tdr. hill ii\tdr. hill:\ti'm sorry.\ti'm just getting annoyed about  this, because the point is that , you know, mr . manafort has  also been subject  i don't know hi m either.\tbut there's  been a tri al i n which he was convicted of certain activity.  and i like to believe that the law was abided by in pursuing,  you know, what he did.  and, again, as i've said, corruption is our achilles  heel here in the united states.\tand i am shocked, again,  that we've had the failure of im agin at i on to realize that the  russians could targe t us in the same way that they use  corruption in ukraine, belaru s, moldova, armenia, georgia.  we, unfortunately, by not cleaning up our own act, have given  them the doors in which they can walk through and mess around  in our system.  and if mr. manafort did half of the things that he was  unclassified\t  said to do, shame on him.\tokay?\tand i don' t know him.\tand,  again, this is not a partisan discussion.\tand, frankly, what  he did should not be subject to, you know, this kind of back  and forth either.  mr. zeldin:\tjust kind of unpacking that back and forth  and the origin of it , the first question, the answer was that  it was  and i don't want to put words in your mouth, so  please correct me if this is not accurate.\tbut the answer to  the first question was where you concluded ukraine did not  interfere in the u.s. election? ii\tdr. hill:\tthe ukrainian government did not interfere in  the u.s. election.\tthe ukrainian government did not do that.  the ukrainian special services also di d not interfere in our  election.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.\tthe followup question and answers,  the answer is that i t's your assessment that where there was  interference by ukrainians that it's your assessment that it  didn't change the election results.\tso i see that there is  an interpretation  mr. wolosky:\tthat misstates her testimony.  dr. hill:\tit also misstates it.\ti have no basis   mr. zeldin:\tfeel free to correct it.\ti'm just   mr. wolosky:\twe just said it misstated her testimony,  so go to your next question, please.  mr. zeldin:\tso the first answer is, it's your position      unclassified\t  that the ukrainian government did not interfere with the u.s.  election, correct?  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  mr. zeldin:\tdid ukrainians interfere with the u.s.  election?  dr. hill:\ti mean, look, this is  any foreign  individual  the way tha t you' re going with this question is  any foreign individual who evinced any kind of interest in  the campaigns or tried to meet with anyone in any campaign  and i just said to you before, i can come up in my own ii\taccounting of a whole range of people who are foreign  i ndi vi duals who wanted to meet with the various campaigns  then that would count as interference, anybody wanting to  meet with anybody in any campaign to talk to anybody.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.\tas far as    dr. hill:\tso did some ukrainians want to talk to   yes, but so did some chinese, did a lot of russi ans.\tand  there were a lot more russians that were trying to get  involved in all kinds of people's campaigns.\ti myself  witnessed some of this, and it wasn't just on, you know, the  kind of democratic or the republican side.  and, i mean, this is not the nature of my testimony  because it's when i was in, you know, not in my current job,  but when i was at the brookings institution.\tbut remember,  i've been the national i ntelli gence officer for russia before      unclassified\t  this for / years.\tso a lot of the information i have is  classi fi ed.  and i know from my previous position about how many  people who were trying to gain influence into our politics.  and it's very  the russians want to show that, in fact,  that it wasn' t them that were involved in .  mr. zeldin: was\tinvolved in any of the  ukra i ni ans' efforts to interfere with u.s. elections?   dr. hill:  mr. zeldin:  tampering with our election systems?\tno. all right.\twas\tconnected at  ii\tall to any of the activities of ukrainians to i nterfere with  the u.s. election?  dr. hill:\ti can't answer that question.\tno, i can't  answer that question.  the chairman:\tand just to be clear whether we're  talking about on the basis of press reports or are we talking  about witness' personal knowledge?  mr. zeldin:\tthe witn ess' personal knowledge.  dr. hill:\tmy personal knowledge, no.\tmy personal  knowledge, no.\ti mean, the re were a lot, a lot of press  reports purporting to all ki nds of things, and i'm not  testifying about press reports.  mr. zeldin:\tso that i don't misunderstand your answer,  based on your personal knowledge, you' re not aware of  being connected to any ukrainians attempting to  unclassified\t  interfere with the u.s. election?  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  and i also want to just point out here that our  i ntelli gence agencies were pretty thorough about a lot of the  i nvesti gati ons and things here.  by mr. castor:  q\twho was your predecessor at the nsc?  a\tmy predecessor at the nsc  well, there would have  been two predecessors, because thi s was an amalgamation of  two bureaus.\tthe immediate predecessor would have been  celeste wallander for russia, central asia, i guess, but  probably not ukraine.  q\twho had the ukraine portfolio?  a\ti think it would have been charles kupchan.  q\ti'm sorry, what was his last name?  a\tcharles kupchan.\the's a professor at georgetown.  q\tand then who had the ukraine portfolio before  vi ndman?  a\tcatherine croft, who was the ukraine desk officer  at the state department and then went to work with ambassador  volker.  q\tand what was the timeframe that she had the ukraine  portfolio?  a\tup until the summer of .\tand before her it  was\toh, i can't remember who was before her.\tthere were  unclass ified\t  severa l changes of directorates in the time that  of  directors in the time that i was there.  look, and i'm sorry to get testy about, you know, thi s  back and forth, because i'm rea lly worried about these  conspiracy theories, and i'm worried that all of you are  going to go down a rabbit hole, you know, looking for things  that are not going to be at all helpful to the american  people or to our future election in .  you just had the senate report coming out informing us  all yet again, a bi part i san, nonpartisan report from the ii\tsenate about the risk that there is to our elections.\tif we  have people running around chasing rabbit holes because rudy  giuliani or others have been feeding information to the hill,  politico, we are not going to be prepared as a country to  push back on thi s agai n.\tthe russians thrive on  misinformation and disinformation.  and i just want to say that that was the reason that i  went into the administration when i was asked by general  flynn, k.t. macfarland, and general kellogg.\twe're in peril  as a democracy because of other people interfering here.  and it doesn' t mean to say that other people haven't  also been trying to do things, but the russians were who  attacked us in , and they're now writing the script for  others to do the same.\tand if we don't get our act together,  they will continue to make fools of us internationally.  unclassified\t    mr. jordan:\tdr. hill, was christopher steele's dossier  a rabbit hole?  dr. hill:\ti think it was a rabbit hole.  mr. jordan:\tyou think the russians were trying to  influence us and get us to buy into something that was  absolutely not true?  dr. hill:\tbut that was not on any basis  once i got  into the administration i didn't see that that was a rabbit  hole that my former colleagues in the national intelligence  council had gone down to.\tthe way that the russians operate ii\t\tis that they will use whatever conduit they can to put out  information that i s both real and credible but that also  masks a great deal of disinformation.  so i've written a book on vladi mir putin, and if you,  you know, have a moment when you want to have a sleep aid,  you know, late at night, i've laid all of that out there.  and putin himself has gone around, you know, claiming there  were dossiers on him tryi ng to redirect people to look in  other places for information.  when i was at the national intelli gence council there  was some person who kept constantly writing to us, telling us  that we were missing, you know, whole things about , you know,  vladimir putin, which was clearly, you know, kind of an  effort on the part of the russians to send us down rabbit  holes of inquiry that would kind of distract us from looking      unclassified\t  at the actual issues that we should be really concerned  about.\tand this was under the bush administration.  mr. jordan:\tso i just want to be clear, there was a  story done in politico on you last month.\tin that reporting  it says steele might have been played by the russians into  spreading di sin forma tion.\tthat's what you think happened  with  dr. hill:\tit's very likely that the russians planted  disinformation in and among other information that may have  been truthful, because that's exactly, again, the way that ii\tthey operate.\tand i think everyone should always be  cognizant of that.  mr. jordan:\tyeah.\tso information that christopher  steele was played by the russians, that information was used,  as you well know, by our justice department, specifically our  fbi, as part of the basis for securing a warrant to spy on an  american citizen.  dr. hill:\ti think i t's already come out that that  wasn't exactly the case, that the dossier was basically out  there when those investigations had already taken place.  mr. jordan:\twell, that's not accurate.\tit was part of  what was taken  dr. hill:\twell, some of the information was that it had  come through other ways.\tbut, look, i don't want to also get  into, again, a discussion that could go down a classified      unclassified\t  avenue because i just want to tell you on, you know, really  good authority that the russians  i mean, again, we should  all know this, the senate has reconfirmed this again   attacked  mr. jordan:\ti'm not disputing that.  dr. hill:\tattacked our democracy.  and also, the point that actually hasn't come out and,  again, why i've been very cross in the media, is that the  president was attacked as well, because the russians sought  to discredit him. ii\tand i've been very unhappy with the media coverage of  all of this, which is why i don't want to start, you know,  kind of basically doing testimony by virtue of an article  that you've read in politico.\tbecause everybody wants to  sensationalize things, everybody wants to spend time looking  at the things that seem sexy, and they don't want to actually  look at, you know, talk to what the facts are.  mr. jordan:\ti'm not trying to do that.  doctor, tell me about your relationship with  christopher steele.  dr. hil l:\the was my counterpart when i was the  director, the national intelligence officer.\t  \t  mr. jordan:\tand so   dr. hil l:\tso inevitably, when i had to do liaison      unclassified\t  meetings with the u.k., he was the person i had to meet with.  mr. jordan:\tand so you had a worki ng relationship with  him for how long?  dr. hill:\tfor the whole period that i was national  intelligence officer, so that would be from  to the end \tof .  mr. jordan:\tokay.  dr. hill:\tso anybody who was working in the  intelligence agencies at the time   mr. jordan:\ti get it.  \tdr. hill:\twho was dealing with russia would have to  deal with him.\the retired \t, as i understand,  at the end of .  mr. jordan:\tthe story on you says that you spoke with  him in .\tso can you tell me about that conversation?  dr. hill:\tthat was prior to the time that i had any  knowledge about the dossier.\the was constantly trying to  drum up business, and he had contacted me because he wanted  to see if i could give him a contact to some other  individual, who actually i don't even recall now, who he  could approach about some business issues.  mr. jordan:\tand earlier you said there were all kinds  of folks who contacted you from time to time wanting to get  i nvolved and have contact with various poli ti cal campaigns.  is mr. steele one of those i ndivi duals?  unclassified\t  dr. hill:\the was not.  mr. jordan:\the was not, okay.  and then the same article mentions that you, when you  were hired, as soon as you were hired you told mr. mcmaster  that you had worked with mr. steele.\tis that right?  dr. hill:\tyes, in the course of my official duties as  nio, because i thought, obviously, given the situation, it  would be worth saying that.\ti also told ambassador bolton  this as well.  mr. jordan:\tokay.\tand you did that based on the fact  that steele was in the news?  dr. hil l:\tcorrect.  mr. jordan:\tokay.\tand you did that after you were  hi red or before you were hired?  dr. hill:\ti mentioned it to general kellogg when he was  interviewing me as well.  mr. jordan:\tokay.  dr. hill:\ti mean, you can't, you know, choose who you   have to interact with.  mr. jordan:\tno.\ti just want to know   dr. hill:\tand at that point christopher steele was the \t   point person for dealing with russia.  mr . jordan:\tgreat.  mr. zeldin:\tdr. hill, are you aware of any interaction  between mr. steele and ukrainians      unclassified\t  dr. hill :. i'm not.  mr. zeldin:\t involved in the dossier?  dr. hill:\ti have no knowledge whatsoever of how he  developed that dossier, none, i just want to state that.\tthe  first time i saw that dossier was the day before it was  published in buzzfeed when a colleague, like it seemed to be  about half of washington, d.c., had it and showed me a copy  of it and i was shocked.\tand then it appeared in buzzfeed  the next day.  mr. jordan:\tand when you read it you were convinced ii\tthat it was   dr. hill:\tthat was when i expressed the misgivings and  concern that he could have been played.  mr. jordan:\tyep.\tokay.\tthank you.  dr. hill:\tbecause if you also think about it, the  russians would have an ax to grind against him given the job  that he had previously.\tand if he started going back through  his old contacts and asking about, that would be a perfect  opportunity for people to feed some kind of misinformation.  i had no basis on which to assess that.  mr. castor:  q\twe learned during the course of our investigation  that steele was desperate to see that donald trump was not  elected president.\tdo you   a\ti don' t know anything about that at all, no.  unclassified\t  q\thow does the national security staff staff the vice  president?\tis there a separate unit that   a\the has a separate unit.\tbut we, in my directorate,  work very closely with the series of people, again, that he  has detailees often for just a year at a time who rotate  around.\tand we try to keep them as informed as possible  about everything that's happening in our area of  responsibility, especially, as i said, that's in the context  of, you know, your question about red flags.  i wanted them to know that, you know, if we were  discussing the possibility of a vice presidential visit, that  there would be issues that we might be concerned about to be,  you know, very careful about, you know, protecting the  integrity of the vice presidency and the vice president.  because the vice president played actually a very  important foreign policy and diplomatic role in terms of his  outreach, and especially this vice president like, you know,  predecessors has really kind of stepped up where there's been  a conflict or where there's been some special care needed,  you know, for a country that, you know, perhaps i sn' t one of  the top allies but, you know, certainly might need some  attention.  and , you know, vice president pence has been, you know,  extremely good about stepping up when asked, you know, to go  and, you know, give speeches for munich security council  unclassified\t  conference and other settings, for example.  but the other thing, it's often very difficult for him  to do these trips because of course he can't be out of the  country when the president is, and he has got other domestic  obligations, not least being here as representative as well.  q\tright.\tthere was some question about whether vice  president pence was going to attend zelensky's inauguration?  a\tit depended on the date.\ti mean , we were hoping,  you know, if others couldn't attend that he could.\ti mean, i  myself couldn't attend because of the date, that the way that ii\tit  again, there were several different dates, and then the  date that was announced in may was very quickly announced.  q\tri ght.  a\tit was, you know, kind of basically with a couple  of days' notice.  q\tso the decision not to send the vice president had  nothing to do with  a\twell   q\t anything other than his schedule?  a\ti can't say with any  with complete certainty.\ti  did flag already that there were some problems, but i have no  reason to believe  you know, i flagged to his staff , to  general kellogg that there were some issues, you know, kind  of noise going on around ukraine that was worrisome and that  we'd need to get to the bottom of.\tbut i have no basis to  unclassified\t  say that he was told not to go.\ti think it would have been a  real stretch for his schedule.  q\tokay.\thow big is the nsc staff for the vice  president?  a\tto be honest, i don't know.\ti don't know the  numbers.\tit's not big at all, maybe about  people total.  q\twhich is about the same size as your   a\tis that about ri ght, derek,  people at the vice  presi dent's staff?  mr. harvey:\ti think so.  by mr. castor:   q   a  and tha t's about the same size yeah , which is why we always tri ed to help.   q\t as your   a\tyeah.\ti mean, no one can say that the vice  presi dent is overstaffed.  mr. bitar:\tjust for the record, that was derek harvey  answering.  dr. hill:\tyeah, derek harvey, yes.\tyou know, i asked  him because i could see him and i know that he would, you  know  mr. bitar:\tfor the reporter.  dr. hill:\ti'm sorry.\tyes.\tyep.  mr. castor:  q\tvice president biden had a role overseeing ukraine  unclassified\t  policy.\tdo you know anything about that?  a\tit was, you know, as far as i understand, you know,  part of the division of labor from the previous  administration.\ti mean, as i said, vice presidents often,  you know, step up and play particular roles.  when i was in the bush administration as ni, vice  president cheney had actually played a very active role on  the former soviet union, gave many speeches.\tand i often had  to go and brief him as well when i was ni.  q\twhen you left the nsc on july th, could you just ii\tgo through your direct reports again?  a\tthere was my assistant.\tdo you need me to name  them all for the record?  q\tthat would be helpful.  a\tso there was my assistant\the was an  nsc direct hire.\the's no longer there because he had agreed  to be there for the year that i was there and then he would  transition off.\the's gone to the treasury department.  there was\t, who was basically detailed  from treasury, and she and i started around the same time and  ended the same time.\tshe'd also had an agreement to be there  for  years, and treasury was understaffed and wanted to pull  her back.  ther e was john erath, who was the deputy senior  director.\tjohn had been there for about a year and from  unclassified\t  state department , and he had previously been detailed out to  the defense department and all kinds of other  nato.\the's,  you know, kind of a quite longserving state department  official who covered the whole gamut of issues.  there was  sorry.\ti'm closing my mind to kind of do  the desk things in order here. \t     who was detailed from \t  and covered the entire eastern flank of  nato.\ti mentioned before that some people ended up with a  huge portfolio of countries, so we had everything from the ii\tbaltic states all the way down to kind of romania, bulgaria,  poland, you know, all those other countries.  there was\t, who was detailed from  \t   who was covering the u.k., france, the  netherlands, and the western european countries.\the's gone  back to  there was\t, also from   who was our nato director.\tand he had a smaller portfolio  because nato is very wide ranging on a whole host of issues.  there was\t, who was the director for turkey,  greece, the aegean, and at one point had the caucasus as  well, but that actually became too much for him to handle.  turkey is a /, daysayear job.\the's actually now off   with the  over from\the  , so he was also detailed  unclassified\t there was alex vindman, who, as i explained before, got  ukraine, belarus, and moldova, also detailed in from the j cs.   there was   , who was detailed from . , so we shared with the   directorate, and the nature of.\tjob was classified.  and then there was \t· who was our director for  russia and who was really handling all the outreach that we  had to the russian national security council and very much  focused on just the nittygritty of coordinating all of our  interactions with the russians, which at this point were  actually fairly extensive.  and he did  none of these other individuals worked on  the ukraine portfolio.\twe actually had to ask \tto step  up a d help on the baltics and caucasus just in a pinch  because our other directors were getting overwhelmed.  i don't think i've missed anyone.\thow many people do  you have there?\thow much does that add up to?\tis that\t?  q\tit's about\tyeah.  a\t· veah, that sounds about right.\tand we previously  had a couple more directors and we'd gone  we were  agreeing, i mean, as you've heard and read about the nsc  downsizing, we were agreeing to attrition    q  a  right.  you know, so that directors would not   necessarily be replaced.  unclassified\t  q\tso what was it like when you first arrived?\tli ke,  you know, how many people did you have reporting to you?  a\tin i ti ally there were\tpeople there.\tbut by the  time i arrived there was a reorganization going on, because  we used to also have central asia, and that moved to the  directorate covering central and south asia.\tso one of the  directors already went, and the western european portfolio  was di fferently arranged, and we didn't replace one of those  directors.  so, in fact,\thad all of the eu, ii\tgermany, italy, the vatican, spain, portugal.  q\tin the course of your experience did you ever come  into contact with national security staffers that had a  poli ti cal orientation?  a\twel,\ti mean, i had plenty of political appointees  from the administration.  q\tany political or nonpoli ti cal appointees that had a  political orientation?  a\tnot in my experience.\tpeople did not express  those.\ti mean, i made it very clear from when i came on  in  that i was nonpartisan and i did not want people's, you  know, politics brought into the offi ce.\ti mean, people could  share opinions.\tand i was aware, you know, obviously of a  few people's political preferences, but they weren't in any  way  that was only just by chance.\tbut they were mostly  unclassified\ti  all republicans.  q\twhen you started were there any holdovers from the  previous administration?  a\twell, of course there were because the  administrations\tthat always happens.\ti mean, i was a  holdover from the bush administration at the dni  q\thow many of the ? were holdovers?  a\twell, when i first started all of them would have  been, because my first job, when i came in in march, was to  preside over  that's why i can't remember, you know, all of  the sequencing of directors, because the entire staff were  from the previous administration.\tand from, you know, the  period between march and the summer, that's when i ended up  down with four people at one point.\twe were trying to find  new detailees.  q\tand you were    a\tand everybody left, you know, well, for the most  part, who had just had a year detail in the summer of .  but, again, all of these people were detailed from agencies,  so they're professional staff.  q\tyou were initially introduced to the possibility of  working at the nsc by general flynn   a\ti was.   q  a   k.t. macfarland? correct.\ti had my first discussion with k.t. in  unclassified\t december of .   q  a  continue.  and when general mcmaster  i had to wait a\thile to see whether he wanted to   q\tokay.\tand could you just help us understand, he  wanted you to continue to   a\the did.\ti mean, i came in to meet with him.  q\tand   a\ti mean, i'd been already offered the job and i was  already in the process of onboarding.\tbut clearly, you know, ii\ti f a new national security advisor comes in, he's, you know,  perfectly within his rights to decide not to proceed.  q\tbut he  a\tand i didn't know him well.\ti mean, i knew him  somewhat professionally.\ti'd been at a conference or two  with him.\tbut, i mean, it wasn't like i really knew him  well.  q\twhen you onboarded, did you have any flynn  loyalists that you had to  that left?  a\tremember, i was hired by general flynn, and i knew  him from the period when i worked at the dni.\tand there were  a number of people who continued who had worked with general  flynn.\tbut, yes, it was true that, you know, ambassador ­  sorry  genera l mcmaster, just like ambassador bolton, also  did change out the staff.  unclassified\t  q\tgeneral mcmaster, could you identify the  differences, topline differences between how he ran the nsc  and ambassador bolton?  a\tthey have very different personalities.\ti mean,  they've obviously got very different backgrounds.\tand  general mcmaster was very focused on process.\the had a lot  of interagency meetings.\the was focused in the whole year  that he was there on the national security strategy and then  trying to create integrated strategies to pull all the policy  together.  so, you know, it was a very different, deliberative  approach, a lot of, you know, meetings in his office, a lot  of meetings with a lot of staff, you know, going through all  the national security principles.  and ambassador bolton, you know, is much more of the  view, as i think is well known about him, of a much smaller,  streamlined nati onal security staff in which just the  principals interact with the president and, again, small  meetings between, you know, the  he famously has a picture  on his wall that's put in all of the, you know, bios of him  or the stories about him since i t's all been out in public of  the picture of the, you know, the bush white house with  scowcroft and powell and cheney and others just at the desk,  at the resolute desk, you know, kind of a small group.  where ambassador bolton then kept it small, general  unclassified\t  mcmaster liked, you know, ki nd of the la rger, bringing out  the guys, you know, for meetings and things.  q\tthere was some discussion about the whatsapp usage.  a\tyes.  q\tand you indicated that white house staffers  couldn't use whatsapp?  a\tno.\tit was not on our phones.  q\tbut the state department folks, they    a  q   a  yeah. do use whatsapp? so this has actually been an issue not with   whatsapp because it's a relat i vely, you know, recent  platform, but when i was nio between  and , state  department did an awful lot of business on their blackberrys  or , you know, whatever their system was at the ti me.  i think blackb er ry s were invented by , right?\ti  keep remembering times when we all had giant, you know, kind  of phones and thin gs like this.  and we had a real problem at the time capturin g, you  know, the flow of information.\tand when i was nio, i mean,  an awful lot of things that we reli ed on were embassy cables  and feedback, you know, from our ambassadors or the deputy  assistant secretaries, assistant secretaries.\tand a lot of  the information was just not accessible to us because, you  know, they'd take weeks to write up a cable and often the      unclassified\t  information was not captured.  and, you know, obviously, in the executive branch,  because of the concerns about executive privilege, but also  about presidential records, everything needs to be captured.  q\tbut state department officials that are utilizing  whatsapp, as long as they're preserving it for their own  recordkeeping rules  a\ti presume that, you know, the state department has  fairly robust procedures.  we were also instructed, you know, like everybody else,  that if anybody, you know, got hold of our personal email in  any way or, you know, kind of phone number, that we had to  immediately forward that onto our nsc email, which i always    did.     it didn't happen very often, but, you know, as you   mentioned before, you asked me a question, why did the media  have my phone number, my email, in actual fact, it's on my  brookings outofoffice message on leave.\tso they have it.  you know, i t's quite easy to get, hence why i get a lot of  emails and phone calls.  so sometimes i'd find that, you know, some official had,  you know  couldn't remember the sequence of the nsc, so  they'd just use my brookings email and email me, and i would  forward that on.\tbut we were not allowed, as i said, to go  before, in any official business in otherwise an official  unclassified\t  manner like that.  q\tpresident trump's ukraine policy with forwarding  lethal defensive weapons to the ukraine, is it fair to say  that that is a much more robust aid policy?  a\tthat's correct.  q\tand what else can you tell us about the difference  between the current administration and the previous?  a\twell, i, myself  you can find this in the public  record\twrote an oped before  long before i joined the  administration, after the annexation of crimea and with the  war on the donbas, actually opposing lethal weapon  provisions, defensive letha l weapons to ukraine, because i  was really worried at the time as an i ndependent analyst and  based on what i' d known previously in my nio job that the  ukrainian military was in such a state of shambles that it  would never be able to stand up to the russian military,  which had, you know, basically escalation dominance, and that  we were in the danger of basically fanning, you know, of the  flames of the conflict and having the slaughter, frankly, of  ukrainian soldiers.  and also that the europeans wouldn't step up and  wouldn't do anything.\ti mean, this is a perpetual problem  that i was facing on many fronts.\tremember, europe is all in  my portfolio as well.\tand we were very concerned that, you  know, it could become  i was concern ed, and my cohort at     unclassified\t  the time, that it's become a rift in our relations with  europe, that they might actually even step back from  sanctions or other commitments that they've made with us as a  government.  now. when i got into the government, the administration,  i became actually more convinced that there was a thorough  plan, that our colleagues at the pentagon had really thought  all of this through, and that general abizaid and then, you  know, kind of his replacement, keith dayton, who had been  working on the behalf of the pentagon as a special envoy of ii\tthe secretary to work with ukrainian defense, as one would  hope, they knew what they were doing.  and then they had a proper plan for the longterm  sustainability of the ukrainian military, and that the intent  was that the ukrainian defense sector would be able to get  itself back into shape again over ti me.\tbecause you may  recall that ukraine, as a republic of the soviet uni on, was  one of the locus, along with belarus, of the majority of· the  defense industrial base of the soviet union.  so many parts for helicopters and planes, all the heavy  lift capacity for the russian forces, were still being made  in ukraine up until the falling out between ukraine and  russia.\tso we were kind of confident that if ukraine could  get its act together, especially if it could tackle some of  the energy issues as well, which, you know, were really  unclassified\t  dragging it down, energy efficiency, and as we all know,  militaries are one of their biggest utilizers of energy, that  over time ukraine, you know, could actually have a viable  military.  and given the size of the country and, you know, the  size of the population, ukraine could actually potenti ally  over time become a formidable military power, like the poles  were already becoming in eastern europe.  and so there was a plan there.\tso i, you know,  everybody changes their mind, you know, and kind of learns  things, i, you know, was basically persuaded that, you know,  this was actually worth doing, even though i still had qualms  about russian escalation dominance and was worried about how  this would be provided and making sure not to provoke the  russians.  q\tso you came around to the view that it was  a\ti did.\ti mean, i didn't want to use it as a way of  just, you know, sticking a finger up to the russians, you  know, which is kind of  you know, there were a few people  that wanted to say, hey, you know, here, russians, you know,  kind of we're taking these actions, but it was very few.\ti  wanted to make sure that it was part of a well thought out  policy.  mr. castor:\ti have about just shy of ,  minutes.  does anybody, any members have any questions?      unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\tdr. hill, ambassador volker made it sound  like many in the u.s. government working on these issues  really wanted the meeting with zelensky to happen.\tand  earlier you're testifying a little bit about the desire for a  meeting between president trump and z lensky.\tcan you just  help me better understand your interest and your team's  interest in wanting to set up a meeting between president  trump and president zelensky?    i i                             unclassified\t   dr. hill:\twell, there was a bit of a split there as  well.\tyou know, i think i've made myself clear, but i'll,  you know, be more clear.\tthat myself and ambassador bolton  and, you know, some other parts of our team did not believe  we should be having a meeting with president zelensky  i  mean w e writ large as the u.s. government at the highest  levels  until we were very sure how the ukrainian rada  parliamentary elections would play out.\tand also, then, we  could be really sure\twhich, you know, nothing is ever ii really sure  about how much zelensky was going to be under  the influence of var i ous oligarchs.  and, again, i was concerned, as was ambassador bolton,  that there was all this extraneous activity going on that  would one way or another impact on this meeting in ways in  which  and this is actually my worst nightmare, what's  happen i ng now, that this could, you know, basically spin out  and put, you know, kind of the united states in a very bad  position because i di d not know exactly what mr. giuliani was  doing.\tso we are now living my worst nightmare.  mr. zeldin:\tas far as people inside of the united  states government working on the ukraine i ssue, there was a  difference of opinion and desire of whether or not to set up  a meeting between president trump and president zelensky?  dr. hill:\tyeah, overall, we all wanted to have a     unclassified\t  meet i ng, but under the right kind of circumstances, you know,  with the right messaging and the right discussion because it  was important for the legitimization of the new ukrainian  government and as a strong symbol of u.s. solidarity with  ukraine.  i mean, ukraine is in a really remarkable and very  difficult position.\ti mean, it first got its independence  after the collapse of the soviet union and  lee will  actually remember this.\tback in , we all worked on a  report called back in the ussr when we were at the kennedy  school that was basically documenting all of the efforts that  the russian government and boris yeltsin were actually making  to subvert the sovereignty of all of the new countries that  emerged out of the soviet union.  and we basically highlighted ukraine as being the most  vulnerable at that particular juncture because this was the  period when ukraine was being pushed to give up its nuclear  weapons.\tand we actually wrote in the report that ukraine  shouldn't give up its nuclear weapons because there was a  good chance that they would then be predated upon by the  russians.\tand this was then addressed by the budapest  memorandum in late .  and there were all kinds of attacks on ukraine taking  this is a long time to go back  but there were lots of  attacks on ukraine, strange assassinations, all kinds of  unclassified\t  threats of military action, including against crimea, all in  thi s timeframe.\tand that's when the u.s. government moved,  with others, to basically give guarantees to ukraine of i ts  sovereignty.  so, when you now look at what's happened to ukraine, you  know, basically  years on, exact ly what we feared at the  tim e has happened.\tso ukraine has basically lost its  sovereignty again.\tand our concern was to show that we were  looki ng at ukraine as a sovereign country.\tand one of the  ways of expressing that sovereignty is obviously to show  respect to their head of state at the very highest levels in  our country.\tit's something that we traditi onally do.  mr. zeldin:\tambassador sandland seems to have a  reputation, from the conversations i've had outside of this  setting and from what we're hearing, that he really liked to  get his hands into everything.\teven though he was the u.s.  ambassador to the eu, someone told me that he rea lly looked  at the entire european continent as his.\tand on his own  initiatives, he was just getting himself involved in  everything.\twas that pretty much your observations too, or  did you have a different observation?  dr. hil l:\twell, tha t was my observation . .and i said,  you know, before that i was  i had, you know, what i  thought was an unfortunate blowup with him at the time when  he told me he was in charge of ukraine, which it was already,  unclassified\t  you know, at the juncture where ambassador taylor was being  sent out as charge.\tand when he said  that was the first  time that he said to me that the president had told him he  was in charge of ukraine.  but prior to that, he'd actually said to me repeatedly  when i challenged him, you know, on issues like this where,  you know, he was running around with, you know,   appearing at the white house and, you know, all kinds of  other things that he was, you know, doing at the time that  were, you know, completely out of the ordinary process, i, i i\tyou know, said to him again:\twhat's going on here?  and he said:\tthe president has given me, you know, this  broad  i am to be his point man on europe.  mr. zeldin:\tdo you know whether or not he was actually  getting any of this guidance from a higher level, or is it  possible that he was just namedropping the president?  dr. hill:\tit is entirely possible tha t he was  namedropping the president.\tthere were many times where  i mean, he was a shocking number of tim es in washington,  d.c., to the point where several people said to me:\tis he  ever in brussels?  and i busted him a couple of times on the street in west  executive where, i mean, if\the was there, he would normally  come in through protocol, as all the other ambassadors did.  they would have a meeting with me or with ambassador bolton.  unclassified\t  and he would have some meetings with ambassador bolton  from ti me to time, but i'd often see him in west exec coming  out of, you know, what looked like he was coming out of the  west wing.\tand he'd say that he'd been i n, you know, to see  the president, but i would fin d from talking to the staff  that he'd only been up to see mick mu lvaney.\ti don' t know  whether that's hearsay or presumption or   mr. zeldin:\tbut as far as him getting involved in other  countr i es outside of the eu, he came across as someone who  was trying to get his hands into everything on his own  initiative?  dr. hill:\tif he met somebody in brussels from another  country, they were fair game, is basically how it appeared to  be.\the spent a long time working on \tfor a while and  actually made a huge messup because he was given a piece of  information from the \tprime min i ster that he should  have actually handed over to state department.\the sat on it  for  months.  and people at the state department had meetings that  were pertaining to that piece of paper, and it had never  actually been handed over.\tand the \tthought that  their counterparts were either, you know, kind of insane or  deliberately obfuscating on the issues that they kept  raising.  the chairman:\tit's time, mr. zeldin.     unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\tthe time is almost up, or it is up?  the chairman:\tit is up.  mr. goldman.   mr. wolosky:  the chairman:  back in.    the chairman:  mr. noble .  can we take a minute break? yes, take a minute break and we'll come    all right, let 's go back on the record.   mr. noble:\tthank you, mr. chairman.  by mr. noble:  q\tdr. hill, you said in the last segment of your  testimony that we're now living your worst nightmare.\tcan  you unpack tha t a little bi t for us?\twhat do you mean by  that?   a  well, i was extremely concerned that whatever it   was that mr. giuliani was doing might not be legal,  especi ally after, you know, people had raised with me these  two gentlemen, parnas and fruman.\tand also they'd mentioned  this third i ndivi dual who, i mean, i guess is actually on the  list of names that you had because i di dn't recognize all the  others of, harry sargeant and when i'd spoken to my  colleagues who, you know, were based in florida, including  our director for the western hemisphere, and he'd mentioned  that these people were notorious and that, you know, they'd  unclassified\t  been involved in all kinds of strange things in venezuela  and, you know, kind of were just wellknown for not being  aboveboard.\tand so my early assumption was that it was  pushing part i cular individuals' business interests.  q\tdid there come a time when you understood, though ,  that rudy giuliani was also pushing the ukrainians to conduct  or reopen or open particular investigations?  a\tyes.\ti mean, that was when amos hochstein had come  to talk to me in may.\ti think it was may th, may nd,  something like that.\tso all around the time of when we were  preparing for the inauguration.\tand he had said that a  numbe r of ukrainians had come to complain to him that they  were\tthat this was starting to happen.\ti also had the   q\tjust to be clear, that rudy giuliani was in  ukraine, trying to  a\tcorrect.   q   a  press ukrainians? or was talking to ukrainians, i mean, in all kinds   of different settings, and was sending messages to  uk rai ni ans.  q\tand was it about these investigations in  particular?  a\talso about naftogaz, again, the ukrainian oil and  gas company.\tand the   q\tso those two.\tso naftogaz and the i nvesti gati ons?  unclassified\t  a\tcorr ect.\tand the board of naftogaz in this same  time period had also come to have an official meeting with us  in the nsc because   q\ti think we're going to get to that a little bit  later.  a\tbut they raised the same concern s, that they felt  that they were under pressure to change out their board.  q\tand with respect to the investigations, i just want  to be very clear, did you have an understanding of which  investigations in particular rudy giuliani was pushing or  pressing the ukrainians on, and when did you come to realize  that?  a\tit was really in that period of late may after  masha yovanovitch had been removed where it became clear that  it was burisma.\tand it was being couched in the context of  energy investigations, but it was primarily focused on  buri sma.  q\tand did you ever come to understand that rudy  giuliani was also pressing the ukrainians to investigate  matters related to purported ukra i ni an interference in the   u.s. presidential electi on?  a\tonly based on what he was saying himself on the  television.  q\tand when, in what time period did you realize that  that was what giuliani was pressing as well?  unclassified\t  a\twell, that began with the articles that i started  to see in the hill and others, you know, from march onwards.  and i started to pay attention to this.\tthere was also the  mentioning of george soros, which, again, has become this  crazy trope where every ti me somebody mentions the name of  george soros, there's a whole flurry of conspiracy theories,  and he seems to be basically orchestrating absolutely  everything.  q\tright.\tso, i n' your last segment of testimony, i  believe you said while you and other nsc officials in the  interagency were trying to make ukraine policy the way that  you normally went about such things, there was all this  extraneous stuff going on?  a\tcorrect.  q\twhat do you mean?\twere you referring to what rudy  giuliani and others were doing     a   q  correct.  as the extraneous stuff?   a\tcorrect.\tand saying, yeah.\ti mean, so, you know,  every single day it seemed  and that's probably an  exaggeration, but every single day it seemed that he was on  televi si on, you know, basically spouting off, you know, one  thing after another.  q\tokay.\tand i believe you also said something along  the lines that you di dn't actually know exactly what rudy     unclassified\t  giuliani was going on, but did you have  it seems that you   did have some understanding at the time of what he was up to.  a\twell, i tried  i worked extraordinarily long  days, so the last thing that i wanted to do when i went home  was watch television.\tand i watch fox news just as much i  watch anything else, and i've appeared on fox news, and  that's how i got to know k.t. i was often on her show.\ti  knew her through the council on foreign relations.  so, you know, just to be kind of clear, i'm an omnivore  when it comes to watching the news, and  but i would have ii\t\tto go home in the evening and try to look on the news to see  what giuliani was saying.\tand then i would have to go onto  youtube or whatever else i could find, you know, kind of  replays of things because people were constantly saying to  me:\tmy god, have you seen what giuliani is saying now?  and it was clearly starting to create this, you know,  metaalternate narrative about ukraine   q\tand about ambassador yovanovitch?  a\t political articles and all these other things as   well.   q  a  q  and ambassador yovanovitch as well? correct. now, so, when you saw rudy gi uli ani or you talked   to your colleagues about his appearances on the television,  part of what he was saying and part of what he was pressing  unclassified\t  was for ukraine to investigate hunter biden and his  connection to burisma, correct?  a\the was.\the was.  q\tso, at some point, did you come to realize that  what rudy giuliani was pressing, these investigations were  political in nature, that these were investigations that  could benefit the president in his reelection campaign?  a\ti came to realize that one way or another ukraine  was being used as part of the discussions and debates around  the elections.\tand that's what i mean about my worst  nightmare because ukraine and the national security aspects  of this and what the russians have done and will continue to  do is something that we should all be  it should be a  nonpartisan issue, and we should all be paying a lot of  attention to it.  and that's what i mean about my worst nightmare, is  having ukraine become politicized\ti'm sure it's the  ukrainians' worst nightmare as well  to become politicized  in the way that russia has become politicized in all of our  discourse.  and so, at that point, i saw all of the above being  bundled together:\tsomebody's nefarious business i nterests,  conspiracy theories about george soros or the alternate  retellings of what happened in , and then also,  potentially, you know, digging up dirt on candidates, all  unclassified\t based on what giuliani himself was saying, just to be very  clear.  q\tright.\tbut did you also have an understanding that  giuliani was working and selfproclaiming to be the agent,  essentially, of the president of the united states?  a\tyes, of course, i was aware of that.\ti mean, he  said it all the time.  q\tand did you have any conversations or did you hear  through other u.s. officials about how the ukrainians were  reacting to this  ii a\tyes.\ti heard from   q\t to this essential shadow foreign poli cy?  a\tyes, i heard from our embassy staff.\tand this was  after masha yovanovitch had left as well.\ti mean, i was in  constant contact with embassy staff.\ti heard from former  assistant secretary wess mitchell, the deputy assistant  secretary, many others, and, of course, there's a whole think  tank world out there.\tyou know, i'm reading articles, and  i' m hearing from people all the time.  as well, we had regular meetings with people from  her i tage, csis, you know, kind of  atlantic council  because they were doing a lot of work on energy.\tand i know,  you know, a lot of this gets politicized again, but we were  meeting with everybody from all of the think tanks.\tand i'll  just point out that our colleagues from heritage were  unclassified\t  complaining to us repeatedly about what they were really  concerned about what was going on with ukra i ne.  q\twho at the u.s. embassy in kyiv were you speaking  with about this issue?  a\tthe previous dcm.\ti mean, obviously masha  yovanovitch herself before, you know, she was removed, and  then , after she was removed, i mean, talking to ambassador  taylor, who had been reaching out and talking to  in the  course of his work, you know, he'd been, you know, very  closely associated with all of the former ukrainian  u.s.  ambassadors to ukraine, who had also been talking to people  as well.   q   a  and the prior dcm, was that mr. pennington? that is correct.\tand he got moved on, you know,   kind of basically in this sort of ti mefram e as well.  q\tso you said, you know, you were concerned about the  politicization of ukraine.\thow does that impact our national  security, u.s. national security?  a\twell, if ukraine suddenly becomes, as i t, you know,  certainly appears to be, on the track of being a par ti san  issue, and we can't have a serious nonpartisan or bipartisan  discussion about what the u.s. national security interests in  it is, then that's a problem, especially as many of the  sanctions that we've put in place  i'll give you a concrete  example about this.  unclassified\t  i mean, we put sanctions, as a government and as the  u.s. congress put in place, against russia because of  russia's annexation of crimea and the starting of the war in  the donbas.\tthe europeans came on board with those sanctions  and have been ti ght ly coordinating with us since the downing  of mh, the malaysian airline flight over donbas, by what  has been proven to be russian operatives.\tand there's been a  very thorough international commission and i nvest i gati on for  this.  the europeans have started to see that many of these ii\tissues, including sanctions that we've put on against russia  from  onwards and now many of our machinations about  ukraine, are nothing more than our own domestic political  games now.  so i was very disturbed and distressed in my last few  weeks at the nsc in discussions that i had with europeans.  one case in point was the caatsa sanctions that you as the  congress, you know, kind of put forward, and the decision to  basically sanction mr. deripaska and rusal because the  treasury department did a completely aboveboard  and this,  you know, is on everyone here  process to really try to  deconflict because when  we're presuming that when you all  put on sanctions under caatsa, there wasn't an intention to  close down factories and, you know, major installations  across europe.\tthey're kind of collateral damage.\tand the  u nclassified\t  largest aluminum factory, manufacturing factory in europe  happens to be in ireland.\tthere are major faci li ti es in  france and sweden and, you know, elsewhere.  and all of the ambassadors came to talk to us, very  concerned about the impact that this was going to have on  their countries and on, you know, major workforces, massiv e  employment, if the sanctions were done to the narrow letter  of the law.\tso treasury was talking, you know, with all of  them and trying to work on a supervisory arrangement and to  try to make sure that there could be no collateral damage. ji\tand when, you know, ambassadors would come to talk to  staff and people here, they got the impression that this was  just a political game between both parties and that we were  not taking seriously the implications of this.  so they began to believe that we were politicizing our  foreign policy, that we were doing it sometimes to target  them or that we were doing this, you know, to basically fight  out, you know, our own disagreements.\tand that means that we  cannot be effective in working together with our european  allies on pushing back against russia or also trying to  enshrine ukraine's sovereignty.  q\tokay.\ti want to  i'm going to jump around just a  little bit to cover some topics that you already spoke about.  the ju ly th and july th, , meetings with eisenberg,  are you aware of any documentation of the concerns that you     unclassified\t  raised or mr. griffith raised with mr. eisenberg?  a\ti'm not.  q\tyou're not aware of anything?  a\tno.   q\tare you aware of whether eisenberg wrote anything  down or made any written reports?  a\ti'm not.\ti mean, in the time when  actually,  john has really great recall, as one would hope in a lawyer.  and  i'm sorry.\ti' m making that shtick about poor lee all  the time here. ii\tbut he was listening very intently, and he said that he  would follow up.  q\tokay.\twas he taking notes?  a\tand i had every reason to believe  he was very  familiar al ready with a lot of this because, again, like  everyone else, he was observing what was going on on the  television.  q\thad you had prior conversations with mr. eisenberg  about these issues?  a\tin passing, i believe that i had.\ti met with him  probably every day one way or another.\this office was  opposite mine, so i would see him constantly.\tbut also, just  to be clear in terms of process, we always had a legal  representative at all of our interagency meetings and  you  know, as one would hope, you know, in terms of keeping us on       unclassified\t  the straight and narrow on many thi ngs.  q\tso, going back to ambassador volker, his role was  li mi ted to trying to bring peace to the donbas, correct?\the  wasn' t  he di dn't have  he wasn't in charge of ukrainian  policy writ large, is that r i ght?  a\the was not, although i thi nk, you know, you had a  reference before about speci al envoys.\twe often saw mission  creep wi th special envoys.\tand, frank ly, i t's a di ffi cult  job for them anywhere because they're given a part i cula r  slice of and are dealing with an issue, and they've got to ii\t\tbring i n, you know, so many other things as well.  q\tdo you know whether ambassador volker ever had  di rect oneonone conversations with the presi dent ?    a   q   a  he did not. what about ambassador sondland? well, ambassador sondland told me all the time that   he did, but i don' t know if that was actually the case.  q\twhen was the first time you discussed rudy giuliani  with ambassador volker?  a\ti'm trying to think about which  i think it mi ght  have been in an unscheduled meeting where i saw him around  the time of masha yovan ovi tch's dismissal.  q\tso that would have been late april ?  a\tlate apri l , yes.  q\tand do you remember what that conver sati on was?  unclassified\t  a\tit was basically talking about, you know, kind of  basically the circumstances of her dismissal and that we  should be extraordinarily careful about dealing with  giuliani.  q\tokay.\tand can you explain just a little bit more  what you said to him, what he said to you about giuliani and  what he's up to in ukraine?  a\twell, he basically mentioned at this time, and i  can't say  i mean, hopefully, he told you this  exactly io\twhen he had his first meeting with him.\tbut he was  intimating that he was considering meeting with giuliani or  perhaps he had some initial encounter with him so that he was  clearly trying to  you know, getting back to the question  before  try to figure out, you know, how he could do, you  know, the right thing, in terms of trying to smooth this over  and trying to deflect away because he was just as concerned  as the rest of us were about the, you know, kind of  politicization or the distortion of u.s.ukrainian relations  or, you know, of u.s.ukra i ni an policy.  q\tand what did you say to volker when he suggested he \tmay meet with giuliani?  a\ti thought that it was futile.\ti mean   q\texplain why.  a\tbecause based on my  look, i'm not a psychologist  or anything, but based on my assessment of what mr. giuliani  unclassified\t  was sayi ng on the television, i t was all over the place.\tand  if that's what he's like in person, i have no way to judge  it, but if he was anything like he was on the television, i  di dn't see the point in having a conversation with him.\the  seemed at times to actually beli eve some of the things he was  saying that i knew to be untrue.  q\tthat what giuliani was saying was untrue?  a\tcorrect.  q\tare you aware that ambassador volker produced text   messages to us? ii\ta\ti am aware because they were in the paper.  q\tokay.\thave you read some of the text messages tha t  are in the paper?  a\tin the newspaper, yes.  q\twere you aware that those conversations were going  on at the time?  a\ti was not.  q\tyou never saw those  you were never part of those  whatsapp conversations?  a\tno.\tand, actually, the timing of it was after i  left the nsc.\tmost of those text messages seemed to have  been in the julyaugust timeframe, as far as i can tell.  q\tbut, in any event, you weren't aware that volker,  sondland, and taylor were having text message exchanges?  a\ti was not.\ti would hope that they would be talking     unclassified\t  to ambassador taylor.\tin fact, that was also one of my  concerns when i was leaving, that they would not have  ambassador taylor in the loop.  q\tand why is that?\twhy was that a concern?  a\tbecause ambassador sondland had done this with our   charge in \t·\ti mentioned before he'd met the   prime minister in brussels and then decided that he was goin g  to be the point person to \t· because we were also  without an ambassador in \t· but we had a very good  charge  like ambassador taylor, who had previously been an  ambassador\tand was retired, but had  come back to step up.\tand ambassador sondland just ignored  him and pretended he wasn't there.  q\thaving reviewed the text messages that are in the  papers, what's your opinion of those?\tis that normal  diplomacy, as you  based on your experience?    a   q   a  no. and why not? because of the content and the nature of, you know,   setting up a meeting in relat i on to this, to something that  is not a national security deliverable.  q\tand can you explain that a little bit more?\tlike  what do you mean by this was not a national security  deliverable?\twhat was not the national security deliverable?  a\tit was obvious from those text messages that they  unclassified\t  were referring to the investigations, and that was not  something that we were pushing from the national security  perspective, certainly not the nati onal security council and  certainly not the state department.  q\tand they were pushing that in exchange for a white  house meeting?  a\tin exchange for a white house meeting.  mr. noble:\ti'd like to show you what's going to be   marked majority exhibit , i guess.    by mr. noble:   q   a   q  and this is i'll put my glasses on.  one of the text message exchanges involving   ambassador volker and actually andrey yermak?    a   q  uhhuh. and i direct your attention to the entry, the first   entry on july th, .  a\tuh h uh.  q\tdo you see that?  a\tyes, i do, yes.  q\tcan you just read what that says?  a\twhich?\thang on.\tit's the one that  q\tyeah.      unclassified\t  a\tstarts with kurt volker.  q\tyeah, kurt volker writing to andrey yermak.  a\tit says:\tgood lunch.\theard from white house  assuming president z convinces trump he will investigate/get  to the bottom of what happened in , we will nail down  date for visit to washington.\tgood luck.\tsee you   tomorrow  kurt.  q\tokay.    and just for the record, the bates stamp is  \tkv.   a   q  uhhuh. dr. hi ll , the message that kurt volker is relaying   to andrey yermak, president zelensky's adviser, how does that  correspond or match up or not with the message that  ambassador sandland delivered during the july th meeting  that ambassador volker was in attendance at?  a\tit seems consistent with that.\tat least in that  case, he's talking about i nvesti gati ons.\tand in the context  of the july th/th, you know, that was more on the energy  sector in the way that sandland  but in terms of saying he  will investigate and then, you know, get to the bottom of  what happened in  is consistent, at least, with the way  that that was laid out in the july th.  q\tbut in july th in the ward room meeting, i  believe you testified you overheard ambassador sandland  specifically mention burisma.\tis that right?  unclassified\t   a   q  he   he did. and can you tell us a little bit more about what   a\tbut this seems, you know, somewhat  well, this is  slashed so i don't know  i mean, obviously, i don't know  exactly what they had in mind there.  q\tbut, again, it's the  they seem to be exchanging  a white house meeting for a commitment by ukraine to  investigate these matters that rudy giuliani had been  pressi ng?  a\tthat's what it looks like.\tthe heard from the  white house is interesting to me because i don't know,  obviously, who they heard from in the white house.  q\twas it you or anyone at the nsc tha t you're aware?  a\tit would not be me because i was not there.\tbut, i  mean, this could be the chief of staff's office.  q\tmick mulvaney?  a\ti mean, that leans to speculation, but based on the \tjuly th, which is  weeks prior to that, the only person  that gordon sandland referenced was chief of staff mulvaney.  and, actual ly, getting to the point when you asked me  before about when did sandland tell me he was in charge of  ukraine, at that ti me, in that rather testy exchange i had  with him, you know, i was tryi ng to impress upon him the  i mportan ce of coordinatin g, you know, with all of these      unclassified\t  different individuals and others that, you know, you were  laying out.\twe had a fairly robust set of i nterac ti ons with  ukrainians.  and he retorted to me that if he was coordinating with  the president because, again, this is part of him saying he's  talking to the presi dent , he was talking to mulvaney, and he  was filling in ambassador bolton  he didn't say he was  talking to him, ambassador bolton, he said fi ll i ng in  ambassador bolton  and then talking to, you know,  bas i cally  he said brechbuhl, ulrich, at the state ii\tdepartment.\the didn't actually mention secretary pompeo,  which i noted at the time i thought was a bit odd.\twho else  did he have to i nform ?  and i said:\twell, it would be nice to inform all of us  and, you know, the  obviously, the deputy assistant  secretary and others .  and he did not think that he needed to do that.  q\tdid you have an understanding why he was   a\the was also, of course, talking to ambassador  volker and secretary perry, and he did mention that.  q\twhy was he keeping ulrich brechbuhl in the loop?  a\tulrich is a special counselor to  brechbuhl  to  secretary pompeo.\tand, of course, secretary pompeo at this  time is on the road all the ti me.\tso i'm\tyou know, it  would be difficult to meet with secretary pompeo on a regular  unclassified\t  basis.\tso that would actually make sense, i mean, but he's  the special counselor.\the's not, you know, kind of in the  chain of command.  and that's actually what i pointed out to gordon, that  he wasn't  to ambassador sandland.\the wasn't, you know,  kind of basically linked into anybody in the embassy.\the  certainly wasn't talking to deputy assistant secretary george  kent, who, you know, on the basis of, you know, the da i ly  interactions, would be managing that in the state department.  and he wasn't aware of some of the larger policy threads  that were going on either.\the simply just wasn't aware of  some of the elements of things we were try i ng to do with  ukraine.\the wasn't, again, getting a regular brief on any of  this either.  q\tdo you know whether ulrich brechbuhl was generally  aware of what rudy giuliani was up to in ukraine?  a\ti could not say.  q\tdid you have any direct conversations with  brechbuhl about giuliani?  a\tcertainly not about giuliani.\ti did not, no.\ti  mean, i did have conversations with him about coordination,  you know, trying to figure out how we could coordinate  better .  q\tand did rudy gi uli ani come up in those contacts?  a\the did not.\tno, he did not.     unclassified\t  q\ton the security assistance issue, i believe you  testified that the first time you learned that the president  had placed a freeze on the assistance was july th.\tis that  ri ght ?  a\tyes.\tbut i learned that as mb  q\toh , that mb had put the freeze  a\tand mick mulvaney had put a freeze on.\tso, just  to be clear, i never learned that the president had put a  freeze on this.\tand this is on\twhat was happening at this  time was there was a freeze put on all kinds of aid and  assistance because it was in the process at the time of an  awful lot of reviews of foreign assistance.  q\tbut had there been any discussion within the  national security staff about freezing the ukraine  assistance?  a\tno.\ti mean, i t was at that point supposed to be   moving forward.  q\tand did you ever get an explanation before you left  government for why the freeze was put in place?  a\ti did not.\tand i discussed with alex vi ndman, the  deputy , and with others that it would be important to follow  up on this, and they should work very closely with the deputy  national security advisor charlie kupperman because he at  this point was also trying to keep tabs on everything that  was happening.\tso, i mean, i kept him fully apprised of all  unclassified\t  of my concerns.  and, obviously, it was easier to meet with him often  than ambassador bolton.\tand, you know, we were aware that  gordon sandland was talking to chief of staff's office.  they're all in the same corridor.\tand we were hopeful , at  least i was hopeful at that time, that deputy national  security adviser kupperman would be able to figure out what  was going on.  q\tdid kupperman or vindman or anyone else you spoke  to in that timeframe express any views as to why they  ii\tbelieved there was a freeze in place?  a\tno.\tthey were just wanting to find out.\tand they  were in touch with mb, and they weren' t getting much  information apart from the fact there was a freeze.\tso i'll  just say that my assumption at the time was that i t was in  this general framework of many, you know, forei gn assistance  items being put on hold.  q\tand do you believe that the assistance that the  u.s. was providing to ukraine should have gone through?  a\tyes.\ti mean. it had a\tbeen agreed on and was  actually in train, but so had some of the other assistance,  just to be clear.  q\tand were you aware that, at the time, dod had  already certified that ukraine was compliant with the  anticorruption requirement?      unclassified\t  a\ti was aware of that, yes, because that's what i  mean; it was already on tra i n, and our colleagues in the  pentagon had been working on thi s, you know , very thoroughly.  q\tsitting here today, do you have any other  has  your understanding changed about why the freeze was put in  place?  a\tit hasn't actually because, you know, as i said,  when i left, there wasn't an explanation, and foreign  assistance overall was being frozen.\tand i haven't seen  anything, at least in the public record, that would suggest  that it was  that the foreign assistance was being frozen  for specific purposes at that poi nt.  i mean, this was also, rememb er, again, at the point of  discussion about cutting back on lots of pentagon projects  for the building of the wall for homeland security purposes,  the border wall.  q\tafter you left the na ti onal security council, did  you have any conversations with anyone about the freeze?  a\ti did not, no.\ti mean, i had a conversation with  alex vindman in the last couple of days .\tand i did also have  a conversation, as i reported before, with ambassador taylor.  but i said at that point that i had no i nsi ght as to why it  had been frozen, but i said, again, that i hoped that people  would be able to get to the bottom of it with mick mulvaney.  q\tdid ambassador taylor say anything about why he  unclassified\t  believed the freeze was in place to you?  a\twell, at that point, he was asking me why it was,  and i couldn't answer that.\tand then, again, i was leavi ng.  so, i mean, i'd left that to ti m morrison.\tand i believe  that the following week they had a meeting.\tso i left on the  th.\tso, sometime on the nd or rd, there was a meeting  scheduled as i was leaving for them to pull everyone together  from the interagency to try to get to the bottom of this.   but i did think that if it was political for whatever io\treason, the wall or, you know, you name it, it would have to ii\tbe resolved at high levels in the i nteragency, and that  ambassador bolton and deputy national security advisor  kupperman would have to sit down with mick mulvan ey and try  to get to the bottom of what was going on.\tand , again, there  were other freezes of assistance because there was a move to  push out the new foreign assistance strategy.  q\tthere's been reporting that the president or  perhaps mulvaney had tasked ambassador bolton to do a review  of the security assistance.\tare you aware of  a\ti'm not aware of that.\tnot when i left, i didn't  know about that.  q\tif there were a freeze\tif a freeze were going to  be put in place like this, would it have been normal for the  national security council staff to have been involved in the  decisionmaking process leading up to the freeze?     uncl assified\t  a\twell, if it was done from the perspective of mb,  this has happened before, so define normal.\ti mean, you  know, in other settings  actually, when general mcmaster  was .i n place there was a lot more process, so a lot more  regular interactions.\tand he always made sure to have mb  and everybody else present in meetings.  and there had been interventions by mb previously, when  mr. mulvaney was only si nglehat ted as the head of mb, to  hold things back and to revi ew them.\ti mean, that had  happened before.\tbut in terms of  you know, by this point, i i\ti have to say in this point in july, the process had somewhat  broken down.  q\tyou testi fi ed earlier about the scheduling of a  meeting between president trump and president zelensky, and  that  the chairman:\tcan i just i nterjec t for a quick  question?\tdr. hill, you mentioned i think, when you left  your position, you di dn't have any firsthand knowledge about  why the military assistance was being frozen.  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  the chairma n:\tand you di dn' t subsequently personally  learn anything that would i nform you as to whether it was   dr. hill:\tcorrect.  the chairman:\t withheld as part of a broad  wi thh old i ng or for a more insidious purpose?  unclassified\t  dr. hill:\ti did not, no.\ti mean, the first i saw of  something suggesting otherwise was really in this exchange of  text messages and also in newspaper reports.  the chairman:\tand the text message you' re referring to  is one in which  dr. hill:\tambassador taylor makes the comment about  this.  the chairman:\tyes.\tand have you had any conversation  with ambassador taylor  dr. hill:\ti have not.\tno, i have not been in touch ii with him at all.  the chairman:\tso, if there were a hidden agenda here,  in terms of why that military assistance was being withheld  along the lines that ambassador taylor indicated, that would  have not come to your attention while you were there and  dr. hill:\tit would not have done, no.\tand, agai n,  though i did speak to ambassador taylor at great length on  the th of september, in which i reviewed a whole host of  issues that i wanted to hand over to him, so ambassador  taylor was very much alert to all kinds of concerns.\tand he  was going to, you know, basically\tbecause he had to in his  job as charge  you know, basically try to look into these  and to try to figure out, you know, how he could work, you  know, more closely with ambassador  well, he was already  working closely with ambassador volker but also with     unclassified\t  ambassador sandland to figure out what was going on.  mr. wolosky:\tyou referenced the th of september.\ti  think you meant july.  dr. hill:\tjuly.\ti'm sorry.\tthank you, lee.\ti'm  sorry.\tmy brain is now more shook up than my water.\tsorry.  the chairman:\tthank you.  dr. hill:\ti apologize for that.  the chairman:\tyou testified  dr. hill:\thow does this get corrected, by the way?\ti  mean, do you go back, do you do the whole, you know, kind of  correction back and forth of dates, you know?  the chairman:\twell, the transcript will read as you  said, and the correction wi ll appear as you corrected it.  dr. hill:\tokay, good, thanks.\tthat was just a slip,  based on, you know, the timing here.\tyeah.\tanyway, go  ahead.\tsorry.  by mr. noble:  q\tthe meeting between  scheduling the meeting  between president trump and president zelensky, i believe you  said that, in your opini on, you were waiting to see what  happened in the ukrainian parliamentary elections   a\tcorrect.  q\t which i believe were held on july st.\tis that   right?  a\tthat's right.\tand i left before that.  unclassified\t  q\tto date, though, there's been no meeting between  president trump and president zelensky, at least at the white  house, right?  a\tno, there has not.\tbut there has been a meeting,  of course, in the   q\tat the u.n. general assembly?  a\tin new york, yes.\tand, actually, i mean, again,  we'd been preferring those kinds of meetings in the past  because setting up a white house meeting, as one can imagine,  is a very heavy lift and, you know, the scheduling is always  very difficult.\tand, you know, basically, we always try to  have a serious meeting wherever we can.  and the initial  even when i was there, there had been  kind of a scheduling aspiration for warsaw on the st of \tseptember because that seemed to be actually a very apt first  meeting.\tbecause after poland, you know, the lands that were  now modern ukraine were pretty much run over by nazi germany,  and, you know, ukraine suffered greatly during world war ii.  and we thought it would be appropriate to, immediately after  the meeting with the poles, to have the president meet with  zelensky.\tso, i mean, that seemed to be kind of a nice  packaging.  q\tbut, as you said, after you left the white house,  you weren't privy to the conversations that were going on  behind the scenes  unclassif ied\t  a\ti was not, no.  q\tby ambassador sondland. ambassador volker, and,  to a certain extent, ambassador taylor about the scheduling  of the meeting and linking it to the ukrainian commitment to  investigate  a\ti was not.  q\tyou did not see any of those messages?  a\ti did not see any of those messages.  q\ti believe you said that you' ve revi ewed a copy of  the july th call summary, the call between president trump  and president zelensky?    a   q  the one that was published in the newspaper, yes. i'd like to ask some questions about those.   mr. noble:\tso we're going to mark this government   exhibit   i mean majority exhibit .    dr. hill:\tsee, we all have things  mr. noble:\told habits die hard.  mr. castor:\tdo you have a copy of that?  mr. noble:\twe might have another copy.  the chairman:\tit's just the call record .  mr. castor:\tokay, gotcha.  by mr. noble:  q\tso i direct your attention to page .\tyou see at  unclassified\t  the top there that president trump says:\ti would like you to  do us a favor though  a\tuhhuh.  q\tand then he goes on to mention:\ti would like you  to find out what happened with this whole situation with  ukraine, they say crowdstrike ... i guess you have one of your  wealthy people... the server, they say ukraine has it.  do you know what the president\twhat presi dent trump  was referring to when he was asking president zelensky to  look into those things?  a\ti think some of this gets to some speculation here.  clearly  well, thi s seems to be the alternative theory for   at the beginning here with the whole situation with  uk ra i ne when as you've been asking questions along that  ukraine might have interfered in the election, particularly  in the references to crowdstrike.  tom bossert has already spoken out publi cly against  this, and we spent a lot of time with tom and general  mcmaster and others trying to refute this one in the first  year of the administration.  q\tcan you say a little bi t more about that?\twhat did  tom bossert do in the first year?  a\twell, tom bossert came out publicly and said that  he really regretted this reference after he read the  transcript as well because this was a debunked theory.\tand      unclassified\t  this was also a muddle.  q\tbut you said there were some efforts early on in  the administration internally to debunk this theory.\tcan you  explain what you did?  a\tbasically, tom and others who were working on  cybersecurity laid out to the president the facts about the  interference.\tagain, i can't say any more than that.  q\tokay.\tbut to a certain extent, they advised him  that the alternate theory that ukraine had interfered in the  election was false? ii\ta\tcorrect.  q\tif you turn to the next page, the top of paragraph  .\ti'm sorry.\tpage , the top paragraph.  a\tuhhuh.  q\tso the president is saying that he's going to have  rudy giuliani and the attorney general call president  zelensky about these investigations, and then he goes on,  lower in the paragraph, says:\tthe other thing, there's a lot  of talk about biden's son, that biden stopped the prosecution  and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever  you can do with the attorney general would be great.  and then down in the next paragraph, president zelensky  responds.\tkind of middle of the paragraph, you see he says:  he or she, referring to the new prosecutor general that  zelensky says he's going to appoint, will look into the  unclassified\t  situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in  this issue.  do you have an understanding of, when pres i dent trump  references in vesti gati ng biden's son, hunter biden, and  presi dent zelensky's response that they're going to look into  the company, what company presi den t zelensky was referrin g    to?    a\twell, i think he means burisma, president zelensky  \tis referring to. io\tq\tand why is that? ii\ta\tbecause that was the company that hun ter biden was  on the board of.  q\tso you had an understanding  did you have an  understanding back at the time that when people like giuliani  were talking about i nvesti gati ng burisma, they were also  saying that hunter biden and joe biden should be  investigated, or hunter biden?  a\tthat was becoming apparent.\tbut, i mean, mr.  giuliani made it very apparent as well.  q\tand going back up to that top paragraph, do you see  president trump says:\tthe form er ambassador from the united  states, the woman, was bad news and the people she was  dealing with in the ukraine were bad news so i just want to  let you know that .\tdo you know who he's referring to there?  a\the's obviously referring to ambassador yovanovitch.      unclassif ied\t  and i know that, later on, president zelensky runs her name  back again, although he mispronounces it.  q\ti think i t's spelled ivanovich in the summary in  the next paragraph.  a\tyes.  q\tand in the next paragraph, president trump says:  well, she's going to go through some things.\tdo you know  what president trump was referring to when he said that   a\ti do not.  q\tambassador yovanovitch was going to go through ii\tsome things?  a\ti do not know what that meant.  q\tbecause at this point, july th, she'd already  been removed, ousted, as you said, from her position,  correct?  a\tyes, correct.  q\thow did you react when you read that, the  transcript, particularly the portions i pointed to about  president trump pushing president zelensky to investigate the  bidens and investigate ukrainian  purported ukrainian  interference in the  election and as well as his comments  about ambassador yovanovitch?   a   q   a  i was actually shocked. why? well, parti cularly on ambassador yovanovi tch, and  unclassified\t  very saddened because, again, ambassador yovanovitch is a  great american, and i don't think any american citizen should  be disparaged by their president , just to put it out there.  so that made me very sad and very shocked and, yeah, not too  happy.  and on the other issue, it was pretty blatant.\tso, i  mean, i found that i couldn't really explain that away with  an alternate explanati on. so that's what i mean about being,  you know, quite shocked.  and i was also very shocked, to be frank , that we ended  up with a telephone conversation like this because all of  the  and, you know, this is obviously going into executive  pr i vi lege, and i'm not going to say anyth i ng more about this,  but i sat in an awful lot of calls, and i have not seen  anything like this.\tand i was there for  and a half years.  so i was just shocked.  q\tand i'd like to ask you some questi ons, to the  extent you can answer, about the process of prepping for  these types of calls in a little bit.  so you just said that it was pretty blatant , what  presi dent trump was saying in this call.\twhat do you mean by  that?  a\twell , that it looks to me like it was in the  context of everything else that had come to my attention.  q\tand what do you mean by  you mean like what  unclassified\t  ambassador sondland had brought up in the july th meeting?  a\tcorrect.\tand then, you know, that rudy giuliani's  commentary  i mean, again, rudy giuliani has been saying an  awful lot of things all the time, and he was pretty  inescapable.\tand after a while, you know, kind of he was  making it crystal clear what it was that he was pushing.\tand  this is very much repeating things that rudy giuliani was  saying in public on television.  the chairman:\tand by that, you mean that he wanted an  investigation done of the bidens and of this debunked  conspiracy theory about ?  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  the chairman:\tand that this was a condition of getting  this white house meeting?  dr. hill:\tthat's certainly what this looks like, in the  context of this transcript.  by mr. noble:  q\tand by this, you mean the july th call summary?  a\tcorrect.\tbut, again, i only read this in the  context of the publication of it by the white house and  subsequently in the press.  q\tand here i t's  i mean, this is essentially  president trump adopting exactly what rudy giuliani had been  pressing since the spring of  in this phone call.\tis  that right?  unclassified\t  a\ti mean, giu li ani has been relentless on this poi nt,  you know, to the point where, you know, obviously, he has, as  ambassador volker said, shaped a ve ry negative image.  q\tbut now i t's president trump pressing the president  of ukrai ne to do exactly what rudy gi uli an i had been trying  to get other ukrainian offi ci als to commit to, correct?  a\tthat is certainly how this reads.  q\twith the assistance of ambassador sandland and  ambassador volker?  a\twell, i can' t say that it was, you know, di rectly ii\twi th their assistance.  q\tbut you've seen the text messages between them,  correct?  a\ti have.  q\tdoesn't it seem that they were, if not assisting,  facilitating this scheme?  a\tthey certai nly seem to have been  look, i wasn't  in the deposition that ambassador volke r gave.\ti don't know  how many times he met with ambassador  i mean, with  giuliani or ambassador sandland, for that matter.\ti know  that ambassador sandland talked repeatedly about  conversations  and you have him coming to give a deposition  and, you know, i should leave it to him to speak on his own  behalf.  but he said to me repeatedly that he was going in     unclassified\t  talking to the president.\ti mean, again, you can actually  ask him because he'll have to tell you all truthfully how  many times he really did meet with the president because i  have my doubts.\ti could be wrong, but there were often times  when he said he'd been in to see the president when other  staff indicated to me that they did not believe that he had.  he was certainly meeting with chi ef of staff mulvaney on a  regular basis.  q\tand how do you know that?  a\tbecause i know that from mulvaney 's staff. ii\tq\twho in particular told you about those meetings?  a\tmany people did.\ti mean, he has  look, and there  are also lots of  again, i keep telling  well, i' ve said  this before.\tany of you who have been into the west wi ng,  into the entryway when you go in from west executive, it's a  very small space.\tso lots of people can say that they have  seen people.  the front office of ambassador bolton, the door is  always open.\tit looks right down the corridor to the chief  of staff's office, to the entryway to the foyer.\tpeople who  are sitting on the staff of ambassador bolton could see .\tgordon sandland going into mulvan ey's office.\tthe guards  could see ambassador sandland going into mulvaney's office.  i didn't have to be told secretly by, you know, some  highranking staff member.\ti could just say to someone, the  unclassified\t  front desk receptionist:\they, has ambassador sandland just  been in?  and i could just say:\tdid he see the president?  no, but he's been in to see mulvaney.  so, i mean, i'm uncomfortable wi th answering, you know,  kind of the question the way that you put i t because i don't  know, you know, to what extent ambassador volker, you know,  was talking  i don't know whether when ambassador volker is  saying, you know, th e white house whether he means the  chief of staff or whether he means that ambassador sandland ii\thas told him that he's heard from the white house and he's  just relating that to yermak.  q\tfair enough.\tdo you know whether ambassador bolton  or secretary pompeo ever tried to rein in ambassador  sandland?  a\tambassador bolton complained about him all the  time, but i don' t know whether he tried to rein him in  because, again, ambassador sandland i sn't in his chain of  command.\tand ambassador sandland, you know, would  occasi onally  and i just say occasionally  make an  appointment to see ambassador bolton, usually when he knew  that i or somebody else wasn't there, just to  so i don' t  know also what he said to ambassador bolton because i didn't  get a readout.  so, often what he did with me, i would find out later  unclassified\t  ambassador sandland had told people that he'd called me and  spoken to me about an issue, but he wouldn't relate what i'd  told him.\the'd just then proceed to go ahead on the way that  he wanted to proceed anyway by just simply saying:\toh, i  talked to fiona, and, therefore, you know, kind of i'm doing  this.  and i'd find out after the fact that he'd used my name,  you know, as the basis of a phone call to just go forwa rd and  proceed with doing something .  q\tright.\tgoing back to the transcript just quickly,  the investigations that president trump was urging president  zelensky to undertake, is it fair to say that those were to  serve president trump's personal political interests as  opposed to the national security interests of the united  states?  a\ti don't honestly see much national security  interest in what i've just read there, and i do not see and i  did not see at any point any national security interest in  the things that rudy giuliani was saying on the televi sion  that i watched.\tnow, i could have missed many of his  appearances.\tagain, they were ubiquitous, and i couldn't  keep up with all of them, but i don't bel i eve that he  anyway, he's not a national security official at this  particular juncture.  q\tdo you see anything that would benefit president  unclassified\t  trump poli ti cally?  a\twell, i think it depends on how this all plays out.  the chairman:\tour time has expi red.\tthe minority.     \tq \t  a  q  a   ii\t  q  i                 q  i     by mr. castor: do you know  ?  i have, yes. and what do you know \t.\t?      what were .\t\t?              what were .\t?        unclassified\t  q\tand do you know what the circumstances of. \t? \ti \t  \t  \t   \t \ti mean, a similar thing happened with ambassador bolton. \t \t     and a  couple of other people, there's just been a couple of people  who have  ambassador bolton's, one of his key assistants, \t, who would actually, you know, know a lot \t\tabout all of these comings and goings,  \t               \t\t \tq\tdid you have any discussions, communications with \t?  a\ti've kept in contact with most of the people that  i've worked with, in a general sense.\tand .\t  q\twhen is the last time   unclassified\t  i          q\tand so when was the last time   a\tthe last time\t•\twould have been before  i went on vacation.\ti mean, in the last week.\twe did a lot  of wrapups with all of the people who were. you know, ii\tpertinent.\ti did a lot of. you know. outbriefing in the  professional arena.\ti often met, as i said, with das kent.  you know. i could run through, you know. all the people that  i met with in that week just to. you know, wrap thi ngs up  agai n.   q  a  since you left  this was part of the whole briefing. you know, and   analytical  i should actually clarify.\twhen i mentioned  analysts before\ti'm an analyst myself, so i tend to use  that as shorthand.\tbut, you know. obviously, we met with an  awful lot of analysts or. you know. subjectmatter  individuals from around the agencies.  q\tsince you left on july th, did you  have you  had any communications with any of the individuals we've  discussed today about your       unclassified\t  a\twith all of my staff.  q\tabout your appearance here today?  a\twell, they know i'm appearing, yeah.\ti mean  q\tdid any of them reach out to you, have any  communications with you?  a\twell , a lot of them have reached out to me and, you  know, kind of in solidarity, you know, because, i mean,  obviously, this i sn't a pleasant expe ri ence for everybody.  and i've had a few people who have reached out because  they're just very concerned about the future of the national  security council, and they're worried that, you know, all of  these issues will politicize what has, you know, up until now  been  again, has certainly strived to be a nonpolitical  body.   q anyone try to i nfluence your testimony?   a no, they have not.   q and, again, please don't jump down my throat when i  ask this.    a i won't.   q when was the first time that you knew you were   coming in today?   a when was the first time i knew i was coming in   today?    q yes.   a well, for sure when i got the letter requesting me   unclassified\t  to come in.  q\tbut today specifically, not that you were on a  generalized list.  a\ti don' t know when the fi rst day would be because i  gave lee a sense of dates about when i was available.  q\tbut it was sooner than  i t was farther back in  time than last wednesday, ri ght?  a\tit mi ght not have been.\tactually, when was last  wednesday?\twhat was the date of last wednesday?\ti'm sorry,  i' m  mr. wolosky:\ti' m not testifying.\tif you don't know the   date  dr. hill:\tyeah.\tno, i'm sorry, i don' t know the answer  to that.  and, look, and one of the reasons that i've been  basi cally\t \t  and  i don' t have a laptop right now, which may sound bizarre,  because i've taken an extended leave from brookings.\tso i  only have my iphone.\tand i've been, you know, basically  trying to keep focused on the personal stuff.  and, also, i wanted to come here without any undue  preparation precisely for the reasons that you've said, so  that no one could influence my testi mony.\tit's hard to     unclassified\t  escape the news, and i've tried to keep on top of that, but i  haven't been, you know, completely keeping track of when i  knew what, you know, because i wanted to come in and just  make myself available, you know, and do my duty.  by mr. castor:  q\tokay.\tin terms of the universe of state department   officials  a\tyes.  q\t that you had communications with about these  relevant matters, i just want to make sure that we hav en' t ii\tmissed anybody.\tthere was wess mitchell?  a\tyes, who left in february of , yes.  q\tand phil reeker?    a   q   a   q   a  correct. and george kent? george kent. and masha yovanovitch? kristina kvien, who went out to be the dcm.\ti met   with her as she was going out.\ti also met with catherine  croft, who i mentioned had been our director previously and  replaced chris anderson, who was previously kurt volker's   he's another individual you're probably aware of, christopher  anderson, who is kurt volker's deputy.  catherine was actually in language training to be sent  out to baghdad for all the period after she left, but then  unclassified\t  the embassy in baghdad got downsized, as you're all aware, so  they started redeploying people.\tand given her work on  ukraine, she was moved to work for kurt volker.\tand i would  have talked to all of, you know, the office, relevant office  directors.\tdavid hale.\ti've also talked to deputy sullivan,  under secretary hale.\tbrechbuhl only a couple of times.  i've talked to morgan ortagus, the press spokesman, and press  spokesperson  and robert palladino  i think he's moved  on  press people, because we coordinated a lot of  statements in support of ambassador yovanovitch.  q ambassador taylor?  a ambassador taylor, correct.  q how about a former ambassador pyatt?  a no. i've obviously had contact with ambassador  pyatt because he's ambassador to greece. is he still  ambassador to greece? he was, you know, last time when i ­  yeah. and so, but i only dealt with him in the context of  things that we were doing in greece. we didn't actually  speak about ukraine, only with the exception of                    \t            so, yeah,  i mean, that was the only  and he's been very good about  keeping a separation from his previous work on ukraine  unclassified\t  because he got burned in that infamous phone call with  ambassador nuland.  q\tkathy kavalec, do you know her?  a\ti do know her, yes.\tshe was nominated to be our  ambassador to albania until an albanian lobbyist group used a  very tenuous tie that she had to chris steele to have her  removed from the nomination.\tso this is another thing of  somebody who was treated rather disgracefully.\tshe had been  instructed as part of her duties to meet with him.\tshe  hadn't met him before.\tshe had had very limited interactions  with him when he was \tin official position.\tand she  was snarled up in all of these exchanges of emails when she  just reported that she'd met with him.  and an albanian lobby i st group also started to accuse  her of being part of spurious conspiracies.\tand so her  nomination to albania to be our ambassador was shelved, even  though she would have been an excellent ambassador and was in  albanian language training.  q\tdid you have any communications with her in regards  to the ukraine matters?  a\ti have not.\ti mean, i've been in touch with her  more generally because she's now got a new position.\tshe's  being sent out to the osce to do some work on the balkans,  but i did not talk to her about ukraine.  q\thow many communications did you have with  unclassified\t mr. brechbuhl?  a\tonly a couple.\ti mean, these were in general  coordinationrelated issues.  q\twas it  a\ti went out to meet with him, you know, first to  introduce myself when he was appointed.\ti happened to have  been in grad school with\t, so i had a connection.  i obviously had met him at some point in the distant past .  and i wanted to go and meet him so he'd know who i am and so  we could talk about trying to do better coordinati on.  because secretary pompeo didn't have a chief of staff, and,  you know, given the incredible amount of travel that he  takes, it was important to be able to have some i nteract i ons.  and we were also concerned at this point about  coordination wi th a couple of ambassadors, including  ambassador sandland.\tso i wanted to make sure that  mr. brechbuhl would feel free to reach out to me if there was  any issue.                                             departure.  q\tokay.  a\tand i expressed concern about that.  q\tyou expressed concern to mr. brechbuhl about   a\ti probably said something about the circumstances  of her departure .\tbut this is only in a general sense.   q  a  q  a  was i t a oneonone meeting or telephone call? i thi nk i t was a telephone call. okay. but it was really about other i ssues.\tso, you   know, he may  i took most of my concerns, you know,  dir ectly to under secretary hale, ambassador bolton, and to  assistant secretary reeker.\tand i also spoke to deputy  unclassified\t  secretary sullivan.  q\tuhhuh.  the fact that the foreign assistance was frozen, it  occurred on july th, which was the day before   a\tyeah, exactly.  q\tyou left.\tso you may not have a lot of  firsthand   a corr ect.  q \tfacts, but  a and i already said that.  q  it's your understanding that it was subsequently  lifted?   a that's my under stand i ng.  q and ukraine got their javelins and, you know,  everything has been flowing in terms of the financial  assistance?   a  i hav en't any of the information on this at all.  q  but that's your understanding?   a  that's my understanding.   q  is it fair to say that this type of stops and  starts is someti mes common     a  yes.   q  with forei gn assistance?   a  it is.   q  that there's different  different power centers  unclassified\t  have questions and there are some starts and stops?  a\tthat's correct.\tand as i mentioned before in  response to this question, mb quite frequently would raise a  lot of questions about this at other meetings in the past  they had.  q\tright.\tand someti mes there's issues from the hill.  you know, members get concerned about something, and that has  to be sorted out and   a\tcorrect.\tand it wasn't clear, when i left, about  where was the provenance of this concern, but that mulvaney,  presumably in his hat as sort of the head of mb, you know,  not just as chief of staff, had put the hold on this.  q\tso these holds can happen for any reason or no  reason?   a   q  a  well, there's usually a reason ­ but good reason.  as you just laid out.\twell, it depends on one's    perspecti ve of good reason.  q\tright.  a\ti mean, for some persons, it would be a good  reason; for others, it wouldn't be.  q\tright.\ti guess that's what i was trying to  establish.  a\tyeah.\tyeah.  q\tdo you agree with that?  unclassified\t    a  q i do agree with that. and i have a couple followup questions from   a sure.  q   other rounds.\tand i know i asked you this  before, so forgive me.  you know, witnesses told us when we looked at the  we  looked at the hillary clinton investigation, and we looked at  the beginnings of the russia investigation last congress with  chai rman gowdy and chairman goodlatte.\tand so we had a lot  of firsthand testimony about  ii\ta\tright.  q\t christopher steele and bruce ohr and so forth.  a\tright.  q\tand it was established  i don't think anyone  really disagreed with this  that steele's mindset was that  he was desperate, or passionate, that presi dent, you know,  trump not be elected.  and so my question  and forgive me if you've already  addressed this.\ti just want to be sure.\tdid you have any  idea whether he held that view?  a\ti had no idea whatsoever.\ti was shocked to find  out that he'd even been  and undertaken this investigation,  honestly.   q  a  okay. because what i knew he was doing was, like,      unclassified\t  political risk.\ti thought he was, like, doing, like,  controlled risks or kroll.  q\tokay.  a\tand all in my discussions with him, i mean, he was  clearly very interested in building up a client base.\ti  almost fell over when i discovered that he was doing this   report.  q\tokay.\tso you have no idea whether he was desperate  and it related to his business interests or he was     a   q  i have no idea whatsoever. okay.   do you ever have any communications with bruce ohr?  a\tno.  q\tyou ever met him?  a\ti mean, not since  oh, i met him when i was nio.  q\tokay.   a   q  because, i mean, he was at interagency meetings ­ right.   a\t given the nature of his position.  q\tbut did you ever have any communications with  mr. ohr about the steele dossi er?    a   q  i did not. okay.   how about mr. simpson, glenn simpson, at fusion gps?  a\ti di dn' t know who he was until he was       unclassified\t q\tokay.  a\t basically named in the press.  q\tokay.\tfair enough.  president trump has, from time to time, expressed  concern, among other descriptors, of director brennan,  director clapp er, and the i r role, you know, in the run  up to  the  election.\twas there ever any friction caused by  that at the national security council between some of the  nonpartisan staff that had been serving under director  clapper and director brennan? ii\ta\tnot tha t i noticed or was ever raised, you know, to  me.\twe did have discussions in the staff that we wanted to  see the nonpartisan depoliticization of intelligence.\tand  hav i ng been the na ti onal intelligence officer for russia and  eu rasi a previously, i personally didn't believe that  intelligence officials should take political stances.\tso we  did have a discussion about that.\tbut there wasn't any  friction within, certainly, my directorate or with any other  directorates about this.  q\tand did you ever have any discussions with director  brennan or director     a   q  a   q  i did not. you did not. i worked briefly about these   unclassified\t  a\twith director clapper  q\tabout these issues.  a\twhen i was the nio.\tbut, no, i've had no   contact with brennan.  am.  q\tokay.  i don't think brennan would know who i   and i think you've addressed this today on several  occasions, but i just want to be sure that, other than the  reference of vice president biden in the transcript, he has  never come up during the course of, you know, any nsc ii\tactivity regarding the ukraine?  a\the did not.\tno.\tit's only in the context of rudy  gi uli an i   q   a   q  okay.  on the television repeatedly. okay.\tand, to your knowledge, ambassador volker or   sondland  nobody was encouraging the ukraine to investigate  vice president biden?    a   q  to my knowledge, no. okay.\tit was related to burisma, and to the extent   the vice president's son was a director on burisma, that  could be a   a\tcorrect.   q  a  but it wasn' t vice president biden ­ i di d not hear that.  unclassified\t  q\thimself.\tokay.\tand you never heard of any  reason why anybody should be investigating vice president  bi den ?  a\ti also did not hear that, correct.  q\tokay.  a\tyeah.  q\tdo you have any concerns generally about the  circumstances of the transcript release of the july th  call?   a  ii\tq  in what way would i have concerns? well, it lays bare the communications between, you   know, our leade r and the   a\ti have a lot of concerns now that i've read it,  but\tand, no, please, i'm not saying that joking.\ti mean,  it's raised an awful lot of concerns as a result of reading  it.  q\tbut as a more general matter, the declassification  of, you know, call records from heads of states, does that  concern you?  a\tyes, it does, actually, as a general matter.  q\tbecause if   a\ti mean, i was responsi ble for overseeing many of  these in my position, and i was deeply concerned at all times  that they would not be leaked.  and in the first period when i was at the white house      unclassified\t  and the nsc in      there were a lot of leaks   of mate ri al, and i felt that thi s was incredibly damaging.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tsometimes it was obvious it was being done to  settle scores int erna lly, because there was blame apportioned  to people who were not responsible for the leakage.\tand i  firmly believe that one of the leakages of the preparation  packages for, basically, a phone call with putin was used to  have general mcmaster fir ed. ii\tq\tokay.\tis it due to tha t pervasive leaking that  these transcripts may have been moved to a different server  or placed under a di fferent set of  a\ti personally never heard of a transcript being  moved to a different server.\tthat also\tthose   circumstances trouble me.\tbut we did move  and i was  responsible for part of that, with our legal colleagues\tto  reduce the number of people who had access to any of these   transcripts    q okay.  a  including transcripts that i would write up from  meetings with heads of state.  q right.  a and i took that very seriously up to the records  office.   unclassified\t  and there were a number of people who left, you know,  from the nsc because they felt very responsible for all of  these issues and felt that they couldn't continue with all of  this leaking going on.\tpeople were being accused, left,  right, and center, of having leaked documents.\tand i think  it's incredibly i mportan t for all of us to have i ntegr i ty of  communications.  q\tuhhuh.\tand you're in favor of, if there is a  pervasive leak problem, to do something to fix it, correct?  a\tyes, but not to put them on a system that i sn't ii\tdesigned for that.\tyou can restri ct the number of people who  have access to it fairly easily.\ti mean, we did a lot to  make sure that you could actually figure out who got access  to them .\thaving been, myself, accused multiple times of  leaking documents, we made sure that you could actually get a  record of who had    q\twho accessed it.  a\twho accessed it.\texactly.\tand, also, being very  mindful, and we were encouraging people to report if they saw  somebody trying to look at their computer, for example, if  they had access to something .  and then it was also  usually, if there was some  concern about the sensitivity of the communication, havi ng a  restricted number of people sitting in on the call.  q\tand what do you know about the alternative server      unclassified\t  arrangements?  a\ti'm not going to talk about it because it's  classified   q\tokay.  a\tand it shouldn't be used for thi s kind of  material  q\tokay.  a\t unless i t has classified content.\tand very few  people have access to i t. io\tq\tokay.\tand do you know  can you tell us when the  migration occurred?  a\ti don't know anything about it.\ti only know what i  read in the paper, and, as i said, that raised concerns fo r  me as well.   q  a  okay.\tdo you know if it occurred while you were it couldn't possibly have done because i wasn't   there.\ti wasn't there for the call.\tso if the question was  could the transcript of the call be placed on the server  while i was there, the answer is no  q\toh, i'm sorry.    a   q  because i had left. my question was, the decision to move a certain   amount of information from one server to another, did that  occur while you were   a\tnot related to transcripts.\tno.      unclassified\t  \tleft   q\tokay.\tso, if that did occur, it was after you a\tcorrect.\tbut it was  i do not have any knowledge   of any transcript that came under my purview being moved to  that server.  q\tokay.\tthere 's been press reporting that there may  be other calls with, you know, other leaders dating back to  the earliest part of the administration.  a\ti cannot speak to that.  q\tokay. i i\tthe july th meeting with john eisenberg you attended  with secretary perry 's   a\twell, no.\tour senior director for energy, special  assistant p. wells griffith, he used to work for secretary  perry.  q\toh, okay.   a\twe had a lot of people detail from doe.  again, you know, you need expertise.  i mean,     q   a  q  sure. and wells is really a great energy expert. so, if my recollect i on is correct, after the events    occurred , ambassador bolton referred you to mr. eisenberg.  a\tcorrect.  q\tand you walked across the hall  a\ti had concerns myself  well, i went out of the      unclassified\t  building and up.\tjohn ei senbe rg's offi ce is in a separate  buildi ng from ambassador bolton   q\tokay.   a   q   a  q   a   q  a   and his office was opposi te mine. right.\tso, on the th, you  i went ove r ri ght away.  went to talk to him? correct. and you gave him the i nformat i on? i\tmean, basically along, you know, the lines tha t i  ii\tsaid before, a quick summary, probably about in the same kind  of length and with detai l that i gave to you.  q\tokay.\tand then he had you come back a day later    to    a\tno, i asked if we could go back for a more lengthy   call and discussion and asked if we could i nclude wells  because he'd been in the meeting with me   q\tokay.  a\t  and i wanted to make sure tha t i wasn't, you  know, kind of, purporting thi ngs being said by secretary  perry to be part of this as well.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tbecause secretary perry had been talk i ng at great  length about energy sector and corrupt i on. and at no point ,\tdid i thi nk that anything secretary perry said referred to  unclassified\t  any of these issues that are unde r discussi on today .   q okay.  a and i wanted to make sure that i was  percent  corr ect and that when secretary pe rr y h d talki ng points,  that, you know, these were  there was noth i ng in ther e  about any of these issues.\tbecause, agai n, that would  explain the very abrupt response to gordon sondland's  interjection.  q\tokay.\tand nothing secretary perry  mr. goldman :\tmr. castor, i'm sorry , do you mi nd?\tshe ii\tjust said these i ssues, and i want to make sure the record  is clear as to what she meant.  dr. hill:\toh.\tagain, about burisma and the  i nvesti gati ons on energy.\ti'm sorry.\ti should 've been more  specific on that , yeah.\tand do you need any furthe r  clari fi cati on?   mr. gordon:  dr. hill:  no. thank you. no? okay.   mr. castor:  just joking.  i'd li ke  seconds back.\tjust joki ng.   mr. goldman:\tit's all yours.  by mr. castor:  q\tyou di dn 't have any concerns about what secretary  perr y was saying during that meeting?  a\ti did not.\tand i wanted to make sure that it was      unclassified\t  very clear with john eisenberg that, you know, kind of,  secretary perry was having one, ki nd of, set of discussions  and that, clearly, ambassador sondland seemed to be having a  different one.\tbecause it was, you know, the  q\tokay.  a\t disjuncture between the two that was what had  immediately got ambassador bolton alerted to it.  q\tokay.  a\tit also suggests that ambassador bolton  ambassador bolton also, you know, suggested to me that this  was all related to the rudy giuliani di scussi ons.  q\tright.  a\tso he had been, in the runup to this  every time  i was in his offi ce, giuliani was on the televi si on. and i  told you he'd already told me that giuliani was a hand  grenade that was going to blow everybody up.  q\tuhhuh.  secretary perry's, you know, involvement in this and his  issues with the lng and the other, you know, gas issues, you  didn't have any issue with anything he was pursuing there,  did you?  a\tnot in the discussions that i had with him.  q\tokay.  a\twe always had discussions about\ti was the one  who often was pushing for secretary perry to show up around       unclassified\t   europe  q  a    okay.  sending him off in a plane to three seas   initiative meetings and other  because he knew what we were  talking about.\tand we were trying to get him to integrate or  help us integrate  q\tokay.  a\t all of the different aspects of european energy  to bring ukraine into this so that it wasn' t just the united  states trying to push on nord stream .\tso we got the  germans, the poles, the romanians, and others to  czechs,  slovaks  to step up and to help the ukrainians.  q\tuhhuh.\tand he led the delegation to president  zelensky's inauguration?  a\tcorrect.  q\tand he was involved with, it's been reported, some  debriefing of the president about that   a\the was.\tcorrect.  q\tmeeting.\tand with all of his involvement as it  relates to these issues with president zelensky, you don't   have any concerns?  a i personally had no concerns.  q okay.  a i wasn't in all of the meetings, but there was  nothing in any of my interactions with secretary perry that      unclassified\t  would lead me to think anything different.  q\tokay.  so getting back to the july th meet i ng with p. wells  griffith and john eisenberg  a\tright.  q\t and michael ellis, i think you said   a\ti di dn' t say, actually, because i'm not sure that  mic hael ellis was in there.  q\toh, okay.  a\ti did say that, on my last day in the office. on ii\tseptember rd, that i met with both john eisenberg and  michael ellis.  q\tokay.\tokay.\twhat was the final determination  of\tyou gave a readout of what occurred in the meeting.  maybe what your concerns were, what ambassador bolton's  concerns were.\twhat was the final   a\tthe final outcome of that was that john eisenberg  said that he would talk about this further. and i presumed  that he meant with the white house counsel, with pat  cipollone. and that he would, you know, raise these concerns  about what sandland had said.  q\tokay.  a\tand wells griffith. you know, obviously, was• also  you know. concerned in the general sense about the  references, you know. that were going out with giuliani and  unclassified\t  the other two, burisma.\tbut he did not indicate that, you  know, secretary perry was following up on any of these  issues.  q\tokay.\tand was that loop ever closed?\tdid  eisenberg ever reach out to you and tell you that he spoke  with mr. cipollone or any other officials?  a\the said that he'd talked to cipollone, but he  didn't then give me any further  but, again, at this point,  having told so many people and also charlie kupperman, as  well as ambassador bolton, there was every indication that ii\tthey were all going to follow up on this. \tq\tright.\tand presumably you articulated to john   eisenberg   a and, again, this i s july th, and i'm leaving the  following week.\tso i don't have a lot of time   q fair enough.  a  to do, you know, followup.  q fair enough.    \tthe   you related your other concerns about sondland, not just   a\twell, i'd said multi ple times to him and to others   that i was really worried about, you know, sondland ' s  extensive potentially selfappointed portfolio and that this  could cause a whole range of problems, because we di dn' t have  any oversight or insight, often, into what he was doing.  unclassified\t  and, again, it's like, you know, the guardrails were off and,  you know, kind of, there could be a lot of problems from  this.  and i'd already gone and spoken to our intelligence  dir ectorate to ask them to reach out to the chief of station  at the eu mission to see if they could actually do a proper  briefing for him again.  and i'd expressed that to eisenberg as well, because  that's also within eisenberg's portfolio, to have these kinds io\tof concerns about, you know, kind of, i nadv ertent disclosure ii\tor, you know, kind of, basically if somebody is being  targeted by foreign powers.\tand, basically, at thi s point,  sondland has made himself a target for foreign powers,  because he's basically tell i ng people, i can get you into the  white house, i can get you in to see ambassador bolton.  you know, you show up at the door, and, i mean, i think  all of you who have tried to show up at the door of the white  house will know it's actually not that easy to get in and you  have to go through all kinds of procedures.\tyou can't just,  kind of, appear at the doorstep and be let in by the secret  service.  people were li tera lly coming up at the door because  sondland was\tand then he would, you know, literally call  up and shout at the assistants in the front office to make  sure that people were giving, you know, their passports or  unclassified\t  any ki nd of information because he wanted to have meetings.  so he was already offering himself as a conduit to all  kinds of foreign officials to the white house for meetings.  and it didn't matter whether it was the presi dent , but with  myself and others.\ti mean, that is, in itself, a problem.  q\tand these are the concerns you related to   eisenberg?  a\tcorrect.  q\tand he was going to talk to pat cipollone and he  was going to   a\tyeah.\tand, look, i'm sure from the point of view  of ambassador sondland, having never been in the diplomatic  service before, i mean, and being a business guy, i mean,  this is what you do.\tyou kind of connect people, and you set  up meetings.  q\tuhhuh.\tdid you ever communicate to sondland your  discomfort?\ti know you had talked about the one  a\ti did.\ti mean, i had that  which is probably why  tim morrison related to me that ambassador sondland was glad  to see the back of me when i had come back again.  q\tokay.  a\tbecause we ended up with a kind of testy set of  final interactions, which, you know, kind of\tas i said,  you know, when i first started off, i had quite high hopes.  he was enthusiastic.\the clearly wanted to serv e, you know ,     unclassified\t  the  he's a patriot.\the wanted to serve the american  people.\tyou know, i didn't get any indication, you know,  early off that he was going to go off on a tangent like this.  q\tuhhuh.  how did volker deal with sandland?  a\ti don't really know, because i also said to kurt  that i didn't think he should be spending quite so much time  with sandland.\tbecause, again, if you recall, originally, i  was skeptical that sandland was actually in charge of ukraine  from any higher authority other than his own interest in this  issue.  q\tuhhuh.\tokay.  mr. zeldin:\tdr. hi ll , you brought up the phone call  that president trump had with president putin and the leaks  that took place and the firing of general mcmaster.  dr. hill:\tyes.  mr. zeldin:\tdo you know who leaked that information?  when you say that you believe tha t it was leaked in order to  get general mcmaster fired, do you know who actually leaked  it?  dr. hill:\ti don't know for sure, so i won't start to  speculate.\tbut i'm pretty confident and, you know, kind of,  just from other discussions that i've had more recently, that  this was exactly what happened, that this was leaked to get  rid of him.  unclassified\t  i was on. you know, kind of, phone calls after that with  general mcmaster when he was being ripped open on this topic,  blaming his staff for leaking this.\tand i know that i did  not leak it and that my team did not leak it.\tand we offered  to resign on that day , because it had clearly been used as  pa rt of an internal score settling.  mr. zeldin:\tyou believe you know who leaked it    dr. hill:\tcould i just offer    mr. zeldin:\t  but you're not sure?  dr. hill:\tto be clear, that this particular do not ii\tcongratulate card was not intended, even, to be briefed to  the presi dent.\tso that's kind of part of the backstory that  isn't pub li cly known.\tbecause we knew that the president was  going to congratulate him anyway, because that's  you know,  the president always congratulates people.\tand we always  have a lot of people wanting to put things into, you know,  presidential call packages for the historical record.\tand it  was the state department that had requested that we write  that in.  mr. zeldin:\ti guess just due to the subject matter of  why we're here, i won't ask further on that, but in another  setting i'd have some followup questions.  dr. hill:\tbut this gives you the, kind of, sense of how  these things can be manipulated, you know, by people, which  is also deeply disturbing.\tbecause, again, this is a      unclassified\t  national security issue.\tand no matter what your views are  of general mcmaster, he's an american hero who served his  country, you know, to great distinction.\tand to be pushed  out over the leaking of a stupid card that wasn't even  briefed to the president is pretty ridiculous.  mr. zeldin:\tearlier   dr. hil l:\twhether he was the right person for the job  or not is another matter, you know, that you all can debate  at some point.  mr. zeldin:\tearlier on, aft er you had referenced the ii\tterm drug deal, chairman schi ff asked a question  referenci ng it, where he used the word i lli ci t in his  question.\tdo you recall that question and answer with  chairman schiff earlier?  dr. hill:\ti clarified, of course, that the drug deal  was an ironic and sarcastic statement that ambassador bolton  made.  mr. zeldin: yeah.\twas your opinion that it was  i  just want to be careful with the use of the word i ll i ci t.  do you believe that it was illegal or no?  mr. wolosky:\twhat are you referring to?  dr. hill:\twhat was illegal?  mr. zeldin:\ti just  it was one question and answer  from earlier on   mr. wolosky: you can have it either read back            worried that something was going on, which is why he wanted  me to go to john eisenberg.  mr. zeldin:\twe might get back to that.\tjust for sake  of time   mr. goldman:\tit's going to take a long time to get back  to that.\tif you could just rephrase the question? ii\tdr. hill:\ti'm afraid i can't remember the exact  phrasing of chairman schi ff's question.  mr . zeldin:\tyou have a reputation, dr. hill, of being a  master notetaker.\tand i don't know if this reputation is  accurate  dr. hill:\ti hav en' t been doing all of it quite as much  as i normally do.  mr. zeldin:\tapparently, you  and you took a lot of  notes all the time, and you had books.\tthe  first off, is  that accurate?  dr. hill:\tthat's correct.\ti grew up in a town that was  very impoverished, and we di dn't have textbooks.\tso i  learned to take notes from basically first grade onwards,  because, you know, otherwise, i wouldn' t have learned  anyth i ng.\tand so it's a habit as much as anything else.                dr. hil l:\tcorrect.\ton the th, i filled up more boxes  than i think is normal and spent lots of time putting in all  the forms about all the dating of all of those books, and i  handed them over to presidential records.  mr. zeldin:\tand you don't have in your possession any  of those books or copies of those books?  dr. hill:\ti do not, and that would be illegal.  mr. zeldin:\tdi d you ever disobey any orders you  disagreed with or refuse to implement super i ors' policies  that you disagreed with?  dr. hill:\ti did not.\tand if i'd come to a juncture  where i'd been forced to do that, i would've left.  his \t i \t? \tdr. hill:\t \t \t \t \t \t   unclassified\t                        \t           did not start formally until apri l rd, and the  admi ni strati on came in in january.  i had already been offered the job at that parti cular  point, but, as i mentioned before, general mcmaster came on  board.\ti'd been hired by general flynn and k.t. and general  kellogg, and so we had to wait a per iod to see if general  mcmaster wanted to continue with the hi r i ng process.      unclassified\t  \t \t   \t \t  mr. zeldin:\tand i apologize for bouncing around a  little bit.\tjust some questions from earlier rounds. \tseptember rd, you mentioned that you came back, spoke \tto your team, and one of the people you spoke to was tim ii morrison.  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  mr. zeldin:\tand that's when you first became aware that  there may be an issue?  dr. hill:\twell, i just noticed that everybody was not,  you know, kind of, as chipper as, you know, i was expecting.  well, i mean, i was going in just very briefly   mr. zeldin:\tdid you  dr. hill:\tbut there seemed to be, you know, just  people just seemed tense.\tand, you know, i put it down  initially to the fact that there was a transition, you know,  underway and, you know, all kinds of thi ngs. but i wasn't  exactly  i was just being honest in saying that i felt at  the time that the atmosphere, you know, was different and  people seemed worried.  unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\tbut you didn't speak to them specifically  as to what that issue was?  dr. hill:\tno.\ti just said, how have thi ngs been?\tand,  you know, a couple of people said, not so great.  mr. zeldin:\tbut nothing more specific than that?  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  but i had seen  and i mentioned that before  that  there'd been  and this is what i did raise to mr. castor  when you asked about meeting with michael ellis and john  eisenberg.\tas part of my outbriefing, i had to have a  meeting with them.  and i had seen an email sometime in the  i don't know  what exactly timeframe it would've been   maybe late august,  early september, just as i\twas, you know, coming back to  d.c. from my vacation, that said we had to retain all  documents pertaining to ukra i ne.  and so i\tasked them, did i have to do anything?\ti also  told them i'd already handed in all my documents before i saw  this.\tso i was concerned about my own obligations, making  sure i'd done proper retention, because, you know, i hadn't  seen that before i left.\tand, obviously, i mi ght have been  more extensive in even keeping some of, you know, the just  generic intel pieces you can often just, kind of, archive  elect roni cally.\tbecause i didn't know whether it meant, you  know, you had to keep anything that had, you know, ukra i ne     unclassified\t  on top and what that meant.  and they di dn' t tell me anything in particular.\tthey  just said that i'd already done what i needed to do.  mr. zeldin:\tso, on july th, you were snorkeling  during the call.\tand at the end of the  dr. hill:\ti could've been sleepi ng, actually, in that  ti me, given the time difference, but anyway  mr. zeldin:\thopefully not at the same time.  dr. hill:\thopefully not, no.  mr. zeldin:\tat the end of august, you said you returned  home from vacation.\twas that the same vacation from the end  of july   dr. hill:\ti'm afraid it was.\ti know that sounds  outrageous.\tbut i di dn 't take much vacation in the time i  was at nsc, and they owed me  or  weeks of back pay, and  they said they'd prefer to do it as a vacation rather than as  a payout.  mr. zeldin:\tthat communication    dr. hill:  mr. zeldin:  so i took an outrageous vacation. that communication at the end of august is   the first communication that you received to alert you that  there may be some issue related to ukraine?  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  mr. zeldin:\tand who was the   dr. hill:\tit was an nsc  you know, from the office of  unclassified\t  the legal counsel, so from john eisenberg and his staff.  very generic.\twe've had these before, you know, related to a  congressional inquiry or anything else, saying that we had to  retain all documents pertaining  any kind of  communications.  and, you know, as i said, i'd already handed in my box  and, you know, did a big purge of my office.\tand i'd also  handed over things to colleagues that i thought would be  useful for them for continuity purposes.\tand that's why i  was nervous.\tyou know, i thought, oops, did i retain ii\teverything i was supposed to?\tand i didn't know what this  was about.  mr. zeldin:\tin an earlier round, we ran out of time.\ti  was asking about ambassador sandland   dr. hill:\tyeah.  mr. zeldin:\t and how he had stated  or you had   stated that he asserted himself as a lead for ukraine?  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  mr. zeldin:\tand that his authority was    dr. hill:\the said he was in charge of ukraine.  mr. zeldin:\tand he stated that his authority was  granted to him by the president?  dr. hill:\tyeah, because i said, no, you're not.\tand,  you know, i mean, sorry, it was kind of a bit of a rude  retort because i was just so, what?\tand i said, well, we  unclassified\t  have ambassador taylor who's been sent out as charge.\twho  says you're in charge of ukraine?\tit wasn' t exactly the  most diplomatic of responses on my part.\tand he said, the  presi dent.\tand i was like, oh.   mr. zeldin:\tbut you don't know whether or not he  actually was given that authority from the presi dent.  dr. hill:\ti do not.\tand nobody else seemed to be aware  of that either.  mr. zeldin:\tther e's a possibility that ambassador  sondland was appointing himself as the lead for ukraine and ii\tstating that it was   dr. hill:\ti think you should ask ambassador sandland  when he submits his deposition.  mr. zeldin:\tyeah, i will.\tso we just don't know one  way or the other.  dr. hill:\ti do not know.\tther e was never any kind of  directive.\tambassador bolton was not informed, and people at  the state department did not seem to be informed about this.  i would've thought that assistant secretary reeker, you know,  and others would've known, if that was the case.  \tmr. zeldin:\tone last question before i turn it back  over.\tthe calendar that we got with your document  production, very detailed.\tyou said it was prepared by  someone else.\twho  dr. hill:\tmy assistant.\ti mean, it wasn't prepared.\ti  unclassified\t  mean, it's my schedule.\tit's just a schedule.  mr. zeldin:\tyour assistant postleav i ngthewh i teh ouse  or from when you were at the white house?  dr. hill:\tno, i t's actually only from the time that my  assistant was making the schedule.\tso my assistant, this  particular last assistant,\t, who i mentioned to  you before, he only worked with me for a year because, like  in many other positions, there was a rotation of detailees.  and the role of a special assistant is to keep the schedule.  mr. zeldin:\tthank you. ii\tdr. hill:\tso, i mean, it wouldn't also have every entry  on it of everyt hi ng i ever did either.  mr. castor:\tdo you have something?  mr. jordan:\tdr. hill, ambassador yovanovitch said that  president zelensky, you know, had one priority and ran his  campaign on ending corruption in ukraine.\tdo you share that  belief?  mr. goldman:\tmr. jordan, i'm sorry to interrupt, but i  don't believe that was what ambassador yovanovitch testified.  and maybe if we could just ask  she wasn't there for this,  so  mr. jordan:\ti'm reading from her statement.\tshe said,  during the   \twhich i think has been public.\tand i  th i nk dr. hi ll  dr. hill:\tthe public statement.\tokay.         the ukrainian people answered the question once again.  angered by insufficient progress in the fight against  corruption, ukrainian voters overwhelmingly elected a man who  said that any corruption will be his numberone priority.  dr. hill:\the did say that, yeah.  mr . jordan:\tokay.  dr. hill:\ti mean, that was his campaign pledge.  mr. jordan:\tbut then, earlier, you also said that you  never know, right?  dr. hill:\tyeah.\ti said that we were concerned, as you  might recall, to an earlier question, about the potential  influence of igor kolomoisky, who was an oligarch, who was  the owner of the television and, you know , production company  that zelen sky's program. the servant of the people, was  broadcast on.  mr. heck:\tyour time has expired.  i'm inclined to take a minute bio break unless  somebody objects.  hearing no objection.    mr. heck:\tvery good.\tlet's go back on the record.  dr. hill, i'd li ke to start, before turning it over to  unclassified\t  mr. goldman.  dr. hill:\tcertainly.  mr. heck:\tyou said in answer to an earlier question  from mr. noble that the president had been briefed early in  the administration that the ukraine government did not  interfere in the  election in the u.s.\thow do you come  to know that?  dr. hill:\ti know that from my interactions with general  mcmaster and tom bossert and many of the national security  staff. ii\tmr. heck:\tthey both informed you that they had briefed  the president thusly.\tis that correct?  dr. hill:\twell , they informed me that those bri efi ngs  had taken place.\tbut i think, you know, part of those  briefings were also conducted by the intelligence services.  mr. heck:\tgood.\tvery good.\tthank you.  mr. goldman?  mr. goldman:\ti'll turn it over to mr. noble.  mr. noble:\tthank you.  by mr. noble:  q\tdr. hi ll, just sticking on that point for a momen t,  can you say anything about how mr. giuliani or others working  with him pursuing this theory that ukrai ne interfered in the  , even though it's been determined that they did not, how  does that affect russia?\tand can russia take advantage of  unclassified\t  that in any way?  a\tof course russia can take advantage of this.\ti  mea n, actually, president putin's whole schtick since   has been, we didn't do it.  q\tand tried to pin it on ukraine?  a\tpin it on whoever, you know, kind of else, and  alternative theories.  q\tare you aware of any conversations between  u.s. government officials and russia or russian officials io\tabout this theory that ukraine interfered in ? i i\ta\ti'm not aware of that .  q\tokay.  are you aware of  well, did you watch any of the press  conference that was held between president trump and  president zelensky on the sidelines of the u.n. general  assembly in september?  a\ti confess i did not.  q\tyou did not watch it?  a\ti was with my mother, and i did not watch it.\ti'm  sorry.  q\tokay.\twell, during that press conference,  president trump said something along the lines that president  zelensky should meet with vladimir putin and settle their  disagreement.\twas a putinzelensky meeting ever part of  u.s. policy when you were working at the national security   unclassified     council? a   i encouraged a putinzelensky meeting   to the  russians when, you know, i was speaking to them as well.  q to what end?   a to, indeed, have putin  because for a period of   time, putin was refusing to acknowledge zelensky as the new,  leg i tim ate ly elected president of ukra i ne.\tand we had been  encouragin&  we, writ large  the russ i ans to adopt a  different strategy towards ukrain e.  and, ultimately, if ukraine and russia make peace, it  has to be on ukra i ne's terms, and it would be much better to  be negotiated by ukraine than, frankly, done by  intermediaries.\ti mean, i thi nk that's the case in point for  most disputes and most conflicts.\tinternational mediation  can only do so much.\twe've still got kosovoserbia, for  example, where we're trying to encourage them to have direct  talks.\tso i don't think that that , in and of itself, is  anything that anyone should be concerned about.  and i had gone out to moscow in between the two rounds  of the ukrainian presidential election at a point where  you know, there was an earlier question, you know, were we  sure that zelensky was going to be elected?\twe were not.  but, certainly, between the two election rounds, zelensky  looked like he had a pretty good chance of becoming the  presi dent.  unclassified\t  and i laid out to the russians that, you know, maybe  they should take a fresh look at this, that, you know,  they' re creating lifelong enmity with an otherwise fraternal  country, people who've been close to them, you know, for  hundreds of years of history, and that, you know, they would  be wellserved to not be just so punitive with the ukrainians  and to, you know, rethink over the longer term.  we also had in june a trilateral meeting with the  russians and israelis in jerusalem just before the g in  osaka.\tand you're probably aware of that happening.\tand i ii conducted meetings with my counterparts from the russian  national security council, by which time, of course,  president zelensky had already been elected, and i tried to  urge them to take a different approach.  because there were two issues that one could immediately  refute with zelensky's election.\tthe first was the russians  were saying that ukraine was being run by a fascist  government and one that was also hostile to russian speakers.  well, zelensky is a russianspeaking jew from basically  eastern ukraine.\tall of his family ties are in russia.\the'd  spent an awful lot of time in russia.\the can neither be  described as a fascist or as somebody who is hosti le towards  russia or russian speakers.\tand they couldn't argue with  that.\tand, basically, the point was, you know, thi s is a  time for reassessment.  unclassified\t  but they were waiting, honestly  and this is why it  gets back to before, where russia was looking for as much  leverage over ukraine as they possi bly can.\tthey were  obviously waiting to see how things unfolded with the rada,  the parliamentary electi ons, which took place later on in  july, and to try to see there how much leverage they would  have over zelensky.\tthey were sti ll holding on to the  sailors from the kerch strait i nci dent , and we'd been trying  to push them to release them.\tand, in fact, we thought that  they might around orthodox easter i n april, and they di dn 't. ii\twe'd been given all kinds of signs that they might.  and it was very clear that the russi ans were looking for  anywhere to, you know, basically put ukraine in a weaker  posi ti on so that when they do finally sit down with them  they'll have the upper hand and ukraine will have, you know,  little choice but to go along with, you know , many of the  issues that were already on the table, of maximum auton my  for luhansk and donyetsk and basically having a veto over  ukrainian forei gn policy, i ncludi ng any chance that ukraine  might have, somewhere off in the future, of their joining  nato or even becomi ng, you know. kind of a member state of  the european union at some point.   q right.  a so it was all very obvious, you know, at this \tparticular juncture, that russi a was looking for leverage.  unclassified\t  but we were hoping that we could get, you know, kind of,  putin to see it's somehow, you know, kind of, in his  interest, a recalculation and a recalibration of russian  policy, to at least begin to engage with zelensky.  q\twould a meeting between president trump and  president zelensky following zelensky's election be something  that the russians would be paying attention to?  a\tsure.  q\twhy is that?  a\twell, first of all, they are very interested in ii\tfinding out whether they can drive a wedge between ukraine  and the united states.\ti mean, president putin has been out  in public  this is not, you know, classified information or  anything from the course of my work, but you can look at any  public pronouncement of president putin about ukraine, and  it's unremittingly negative.\tand he also, himself, always  points to corruption in ukraine .\tit's become, kind of,  shorthand for, thi s is not a real country, this is not a  sovereign country, and this is not a country that deserves  support from the u.s. or the europeans at all.  q\tokay.  i want to go back to the july th call summary.\tand we  were talking about, i believe in the last round, the transfer  of that summary into the nsc codeword classified system   a\tuhhuh .  \t·  unclassified\t        which i believe is sometimes referred to as is that  are you familiar with that acronym?   a\ti am kind of fami li ar, yeah.  q\tokay.\tdo you believe there was any reason for this  particular call, the july th call, summary to be placed in  the \tsystem?  a\tno.  q\tokay.\tand why not?  a\tbecause that's not the appropriate place for these  kinds of transcripts.\tas i said before, they can be  restri cted, in terms of their access, very easily, and you  can keep track of who has access to them.  q\tand when you were at the nsc, were you aware that  some transcripts were being transferred to the  or, not  transcr i pts  summaries of meetings or telephone calls  between the president and foreign leaders were being  transferred to   a\ti was not.\tand the only circumstances in which  that would be conceivable would be if it dealt with  classified i nforma ti on.   q  a  high ly classified i nforma ti on? yes.\tbut, i mean, we do occasionally talk to   counterparts about that kind of information.  q\twho would have the authority to order a call  summary like the july th call summary to be transferred to        the ill\tsystem?  unclassified\t   a\ti'm not entirely sure, to be honest, because i've  never had to deal with that.  q\tokay.  a\ti imagine that   well, i shouldn't imagine.\ti  basically\ti'm not really clear.\ti would have to refer you  back to, you know, other officials to ask for that.  q\tokay.  a\tthat was not, certainly, in my purview.\ti would  never be able to, you know, make a determination to have it ii\tin that system.  q\tand i think i know the answer to this, but are you  aware of whether or not j ohn bolton or, before him,  h.r. mcmaster was aware of this practice and that this was  going on?  a\ti don't believe that it happened on any occasion  when general mcmaster was there.\ti'd never heard of anything  about it.\tyou would have to ask ambassador bolton.  q\tokay.  there's been public reporting about the may  meeting  between ambassador kislyak, foreign minister lavrov, and  presi dent trump in the oval office.\tdid you participate in  that meeting?   a   q  i did not. you did not.\tdid you get a readout from that  unclassified\t  meeting? \ta\ti did.   notes or the summary of that meeting were placed in the  system?  a\tto my knowledge, it was not.  q\tokay.  a\tbut i don't know for sure.  q\tokay.  a\tthere were concerns about that transcript being  leaked, and so it was certainly being preserved.\tand, also,  the fact tha t it was later on requested by mr. mueller in the  course of his inv esti gati on. so there was every effort made  to keep that transcript secure.  q\tand what were the concerns about that being leaked?  a\twell, i think there's concerns every time  it's  been mentioned before  about the i ntegrit y of  communi cati ons, of leaki ng information.  q\tbut was there anything in particular about the  conversation or the  a\twell, the conversation seemed to imm edi ately end up  in the press.  and let me also just keep saying that, every time we get  bent out of shape on issues like this, remember, there are  fore i gn participants in all of these meetings who take just  unclassified\t  as good of notes as i do or, in some cases, could very easily  be recordi ng some of these meeti·ngs. because when you go   not in the white house, of course, but if you're in the g  or you're in some other publi c setting, unga, i am not  convinced that these thi ngs are screened.  and i' ll just give you an example.\twhen i was at one of  the g meetings, a member of the chinese delegation came in  with a big backpack which they left on the chair in one of  the meeting rooms, and it was there for the entire ti me.  q\twhen you got the readout of that may  meeting, ii\twas there anything that caused alarm for you?  a\tcan i ask why we're going over the may oval office  meeting?\tbecause i don't see how i t's directly related to  ukrai ne.  q\twell, there's been public reporting about tha t  part i cula r meeti ng being parti cularly sensitive within the  white house and it being  the transcript or readout, the  summary being placed in the \tsystem.  a\ti was not aware that it was placed in the   system.   q  a   q  right.\tand i understand that's your ­ yeah.  testimony, but we're trying to figure out why   that meet i ng, in particular, could have been   a\twell, that meeti ng  unclassified\t  q\ttreated the same way as the july th  call summary.  a\tthat meeting was scrutinized because of, again, the  press reporting that the president, who had the authority to  declassify information, had talked about something that was  previously codeword, in a general sense.\tand in actual fact,  if that was the case, then there would be a reason to put it  on \t·\twhether he'd said it to, you know, kind of,  unauthorized individuals or not, if he had declassified that,  but it would still technically be classified codeword.  q\tokay.  a\tand, indeed, when we had the readout, we had to  redact portions of it.\tso that actually would not be in any  way inappropriate on that occasion.  q\tokay.  going back to the july th call summary, some of the  portions i read included ellipses.\tand there's been some  public reporting and speculation that there could be other  things that were said.  are you aware of, in the process of creating this type  of call summary, whether there's a more wordforword  transcript that's created?     \tthem.   a\ttranscripts that i produced often had ellipses in   q\tokay.      unclassified\t  a\ti put ellipses in.  q\tcan you explain to us the process by which these  types of call summaries are created, from when the call  occurs to when this type of summary is drafted?  a\tthere's been some public discussion of this, but i  feel that this might be verging into secure, you know  mr. wolosky:\ti'm sorry.\tcould you repeat   mr. noble:\tyeah.\ti was asking her to explain the  process of creating a call summary.\tso there's a call that  occurs.\twhat's the process by which notes are taken?\tis  there a verbatim transcript created?  dr. hill:\tis that fine to talk about?  mr. wolosky:\tyou can talk about the process  dr. hill:\tprocess.\tokay.  i mean, some of this has already been ­  mr. noble:\tright.  dr. hi ll:\t made publi c.\ti mean, i saw a piece of it  on cnn or something that was reporting to say how the  tran script would've come into being.  but the white house situation room, they produce that  tran scr i pt.\tthey actually talk in realtime through kind of  a  i don' t know, it's almost li ke  i don't know whether  you have one as a stenographer, but they actually sort of  talk through a device in real ti me as they're hearing the  speech and the exchange.\tand that's how   unc lassified\t  q\twho talks through the device?  a\tthe white house situation room staff.\tand that  produces a kind of a word voicerecognition version of their  voice.\tso they are    q  saying?  a  as well.  and they're repeating what the presidents are   and what the translator is saying on the other end and that's probably  i mean, those of you who,   you know, are familiar with voice recognition  is probably  to deal with the fact that translators and others have  accents.\ti have an accent.\tso, you know, it would make it  difficult for the voicerecognition software.  and, also, i think, at thi s point, we no longer tape our  president.\tthat doesn' t mean to say that the other party  don' t tape all of these communications, just to be very clear  here.  so that rough transcript is then produced and then sent  to either the director or the senior director or both,  whoever is available, to look through, and then to others who  were on the call that's pertinent to their area of expertise  or who have taken notes  q\tokay.  a\t to check this for accuracy.\tand sometimes there  can be some pretty hysterically funny misrepresentations of  what people heard.      unclassified\t  q\tokay.\ti won't ask about examples.  so once you or your director reviews the, kind of, raw  transcript created by the voi cerecogni tion software and you  make all the corrections, are you the ones who draft the  summaries, like the one that we see for the j uly th call?  who drafts that?  a\tthis, to me, looks like the transcripts that we  would draft.   q  a   q  a  okay.\tand then where does the transcript ­ it goes to our  are there furth er layers of approval? it goes through further layers of approvals.\tthat   was managed by the executive secretariat of the nsc    q  a   q  for the nati onal security council? correct. okay.   a\tand then with the white house revi ew, and it goes  to the nati onal secur i ty advi sor and others as well\tand  the deputy national security advisor  to take a look at.  q\tokay.  skipping around a li ttle bit, are you aware of a  compilation of documents, you might say a dossier, that rudy  gi uli ani created about ambassador yovanovitch and   a\tonly from news reports.  q\t othe rs? okay.\tyou weren't aware of that at the  unclassified\t   time  a  q    i was not, no.  that that was created that it came in a white    house envelope to the state department?  a\ti had never heard anything about that.  q\tdid you ever see those types of materials or a  similar dossie floating around the white house?  a\ti did not.  q\tokay.  i believe in the last segment of testimony you said that ii\tyou had some conversations with deputy secretary of state  sullivan  a\tcorrect.  q\t about rudy giuliani and your concerns?  a\tuhhuh.  q\thow many times did you speak with deputy secretary  sullivan?  a\ti saw deputy secretary sullivan qu i te a lot at  events, and i often talked to him on the sidelines of this.  so, often, these were conversations that i was just having  with deputy secretary sullivan, who is a pretty wonderful  i ndi vi dual .\tand, you know , i know he's now been nominated to  be ambassador to russia.\tbut he and i would talk a lot on  the margins of events and other meeti ngs.  q\tand did you raise the  unclassified\t a\ti did.  q\t concerns you had?  a\tfrequently.\tand he was also concerned.  q\tokay.\tdid he say anything in response when you  raised your concerns about giuliani 's activity?  a\the just expressed that he was also concerned.\the  d i dn' t give any specifics, you know, back again.\the just  gave me a good, you know, respectful hearing.\tand it was  clear that he was very upset about what had happened to  ambassador yovanovitch.  q\tdid he ever say whether he ever tried to, himself,  do something about it or get secretary pompeo to do something  about it?  a\the said that both he and secretary pompeo had tried  their best to head off what happened.  q\tdid he explain how they had tried?  a\the did not.  but i was also very much struck by the commentary in her  public statement, in ambassador yovanovitch's public  statement, that they'd been under pressure since summer of  .\ti had no idea.\tbecause, for me, i only  you know,  obviously, as i mentioned before, i just started to pick up  that there something after january of this year.  q\tuhhuh .  a\tand, most definitely, when i saw what i think was a  unc lassified\t  march th article in the hill by john solomon, then i looked  back and saw that there were, you know, other similar  reports.\tand then, of course, i start ed to watch  mr. giuliani on televi si on.  q\tokay.  did you ever speak with michael ellis about your  concerns?  a\ti'm sure i did.\tbut, i mean, not at the request  of, as i menti oned before, when i went in to talk to     q  i i\ta   q   a  mr. eisenberg?  mr. eisenberg.\tyeah. okay.\tso these were because i saw all of them, both micha el elli s and   john eisenberg, pretty much daily, sometimes multiple times  i n the day.\tagai n, our offices were opposite each other.  and it was, kind of, they were with me working on a whole  range of i ssue.\tthis was a big portfolio, and i needed a lot  of lega l advi ce.\twe'd often looked at treaties and other  i ssues that we were trying to coordi nate, and we needed them  to work wi th the legal staff at the state department, for  example, or to reach out to dod for us on a whole range of  issues.  and i just' you know, wanted to say tha t they were the  epitome of professi onali sm, and i've had a great working  relati onshi p with them.\tand i had no hesitation in going to  unclassified\t  express concerns to them about any issue.  q\tand    a\tso i probably talked to michael on a number of  occasions about this, just in a general, hey, you know, this  is going on and i'm worried about it.  q\tuhhuh.\tdid you ever ask him to do anything in  particular about   a\ti did not.\ti mean, i was raising concerns, but i  did do the official reporting to john eisenberg.  q\tokay.\tand did mr. eisenberg or mr. ellis ever tell  you that they had taken steps to try to address the problem  or had reported it further up the chain in the white house  counsel's office or elsewhere?  a\tyeah, i already responded to that, that i believe  that john eisenberg talked to pat cipollone   q\tokay.    a   q   in the white house counsel's office. what about mr. ellis?   a\ti do not know about that.\tand, again, you know,  ju ly th is just  ,   is just the week before i' m  leav i ng.  q\tokay.  on the issue of the security assistance freeze, had  assistance for ukraine ever been held up before during your  time at the nsc?  unclassified\t  a\tyes.  q\tfor what\tand when was that?  a\tat multiple junctures.\tyou know, it gets back to  the question that mr. castor asked before.\tthere's often a  question raised about assistance, you know, a range of  assistance   q\tbut for ukraine specifically?  a\tyeah, that's correct.  q\tokay.\teven though there's been bipartisan support jo\tfor the assistance?   a   q  a  correct. okay. but there's been a lot of hold up of other   assistance, you know, a lot of additional questions asked.\ti  mean, again, clarification.\tyou know, new people  again,  remember, also, there's a lot of turnover in staff at this  point.\tso, as mr. castor was sort of suggesting, a lot of  people suddenly want to know why is this happening, you know,  kind of, who authorized this, what's the nature of it.  sometimes i t was just informational.  q\tbut at this point in time, when you learned about  the freeze, july th i believe, everyone in the interagency  had blessed it, so to speak, and had signed off on the aid.  and so, as far as you know, there was nothing that  legitimately should be holding it up.  unclassified\t  a\tcorrect.  q\tokay.  on the issue of security assistance for ukraine, are you  familiar with the first sale of javelins to ukraine   a\ti am.  q\t  back in ?\tmarch or april timeframe, is that  correct?  a\tyes, that's correct.  q\tokay.\taround the same time, are you aware that  ukraine stopped cooperating with special counsel mueller' s ii\t\tinvestigation?   a   q  i was not aware of that. okay.\tare you aware that they also stopped four   separate investigations of paul manafort around this same  ti me?   a   q  i was also not aware of that. are you aware that ukraine allowed konstantin   kilimnik, who was a witness in the mueller investigation,  slip across the border to russia?  a\ti was aware of that.  q\tyou were aware of that?  a\tuhhuh.  q\twhat did you know about that?  a\twell, konstantin kilimnik is somebody   if we're  in the space of who knew people in the past, he used to work  unclass i f i ed\t  for the international republican institute in moscow.\tand  when i was working at the kennedy school of government on  technical assistance projects, you know, we had a lot of  i ntera cti ons with !ri as well as nd!, and konstantin kilimnik  was there.\tand all of my staff thought he was a russian spy  at the time that i was working wi th.  so konstantin kilimnik was somebody who popped up on the  radar screen from time to time.\tso, when his name came up, i  immediately had the, you know, reminders of the s and of io\tpeople being somewhat suspicious of kilimnik.\tand so, you ii\tknow, i did note that he'd   q\thow did you learn that ukraine had allowed him to  exit to russia?  a\tit was in a report that i read.  q\tokay.\tare you aware of any connection between that  and the sale of javelins to ukraine?    a   q  i am not. okay.   you said that sometimes in your transcripts that you  created or revi ewed you'd use ellipses.  a\ti did.  q\twhy would you use ellipses?  a\twhen the sentence trailed off, it wasn't a complete  sentence.\tand that might be, you know, my english training,  because, often, the exec sec would correct sometimes and, you      unclassified\t  know, change punctuation and things.\ti overuse commas, for  example, and  q\tare you a fan of the oxford comma?  a\ti'm confused, is kind of basically where i am.  because when i was growing up, they changed the comma  formatting, and then when i came here, i found there was all  kinds of different comma formatting.\tso i tend to put commas  everywhere.  and i also do like ellipses.\tbecause, you know, when io\tsomebody trails off, like i just do sometimes, just dot, dot,  ii   dot, finish that the ellipses. thought. so i wouldn't read too much into                                                                                                                                        unclassified\t    by mr. noble:  q\twhile you were working at the nsc, were you aware  of whether kash patel had any role in the ukraine portfolio?  a\ti became aware of that by chance and accident.\tin  the last couple of weeks that i was there, probably in may ,  just after the presidential inauguration in ukraine.\ti   q\thow did you learn?  a\ti'd gone over to the exec sec in the white house  just to pick something up, and this was around the time where  we were trying to  there was going to be a setup to debrief  the president on the presidential delegation.\tand just one  of the people in exec sec just as a routine, you know, just  said:\toh, the president wants to talk to your ukraine  director.  and i was like a bit surprised by that because the  president has never asked to speak to any, you know, of our  directors ever before.\tand i said:\toh?  yeah, to talk about some of the materials.  and i said, oh, again because i thought thi s is  strange.  and they said:\tyeah, so, i mean , we might be reaching   out to kash.  and i said, oh, because kash  the only kash   q\twhat was his role as far as you know?      unclassi fied\t  a\t i could think of was kash patel, and i thought,  well, he is in our international organi zat i ons bureau and,  you know, considerably he works on the u.n. and other related  issues but he's not the ukraine di rector.\tthe ukraine  director, you know, after all the streamlining is only in our  office.  so i basically di dn 't engage any further because i was  wondering to myself:\tthat's very strange.  and i went to talk to charlie kupperman, who was going  to be taking part on our behalf sitting in on the debriefing  for the president.\tand i sai d:\tapparently, the president \tmay think that kash patel is our ukraine director, and i just  want to make sure there's no embarrassment here.\ti'm not  qui te sure why that might be, but i want to flag for you that  this is the case.  and i related what i related to you.\tand i sai d:\tthat  probably means that alex vi ndman , our ukraine director who  had actually been on the presi denti al delegation, probably  shouldn ' t go into the debrief from the delegat i on.  q\tand this was the may  meeting    a   q  a  correct.  after the delegat i on got back? correct.\tand then i went back to my office and   star ted looking at all my distro lists to see, you know, kind  of whether kash was on any of the  maybe i'd missed out,  unclassified\t  you know, that he had some special, again, ambassador  sondlandlike representational role on ukraine that i hadn't  been informed about, and i couldn't elicit any information  about that.  q\tdid you ever figure out what mr. patel was doing  with respect to ukraine kind of behind the scenes?  a\ti did not, but i raised concerns with charlie  kupperman about that, and he sai d that he would look into  that, which is the appropriate course of acti on.  q\tand di d you ever learn what he learned after he  looked into it?  a\ti did not because, again, you know, it's difficult  always to follow up on these i ssues.\tbut i did warn my  office to be very careful about communications with kash  patel until we figured out why it was that he was sending  clearly materials on ukraine over to the  because i didn't  know what kind of materials.   q  a  q  did you ever see the materials? i did not. okay.\tdid you ever learn what materials mr. patel   was providing?   a  q  i did not. okay.\tyou said that you advised or told   mr. vindman not to go into the debrief on may .  a\twell, particularly after it seemed to be the case  unclassified\t  he's evidently not kash patel and that if there was some  confusion over who the director for ukraine is, that could be  rather difficult and awkward.  q\tokay.\tbut you knew this meeting was supposed to be  about briefing the president on   a\ton the presidential delegation.  q\tthe delegation to the inauguration?  a\tand alex vindman was also just there as the  representative of the nsc.\the wasn't the lead of the  delegation in any case.\tand the whole point of the  debriefing was for secretary perry, ambassador volker, and  ambassador sondland, and senator j ohnson to talk about their  experiences and their views on zelensky and to relay back the  meetings.  and alex was only in those meetings as basically a  notetaker and, you know, again, as the representative of the  nsc because neither ambassador bolton or i were able to go  given the timing of the i naugurat i on.  q\tdo you know whether kash patel attended that  meeting?  a\ti do not.\ti had never heard any information to  suggest that he was there.  q\tokay.\tdid mr. patel have anything to do with  ukraine after that meeting, to your knowledge?  a\ti'm not aware that he di d.\tand i took him off our  unclassified\t  distro list because i was alarmed in thinking that, you know ,  this is  i mean, this is obviously just not appropri ate,  and i'd already reported it to charlie kupperman.  q\tdo you know whether any of the documents that  mr. patel was providing to the president relating to ukraine  had anything to do with what rudy giuliani was doing?  a\ti really do not know.\tand i'll be also clear:\ti  never actually have ever had a conversation with kash patel.  i knew who he was.\ti knew he was at the international, you  know, organization group, and i'd seen him i n meetings. i l\tand i was, you know  let's just say it's a red flag  when somebody who you barely know is involved on, you know,  one of your policy issues and is clearly providing, you know,  materials outside of the line that we don't even know what  those materials were.  and we were always very circumspect about the materials  that we provided, and we only ever sent them up the chain to  the exec sec to ambassador bolton.\tso, i mean, we never did  anything to the president's or to the chief of staff or  anything else except through the national security advi sor.  q\tand it's your understanding, though, that these  materials that mr. patel provided made their way directly to  president trump?  a\tthat's what i was led to believe from my very brief  interaction with the exec sec.\tand, aga i n, i went     unclassified\t  immediately and told charlie kupperman about this.  q\tokay.  mr. noble:\tso, dr. hill. i do want to go through some  of the other meetings on your calendar. and i think we'd like  to mark your calendar as an exhibit.\tso it's going to be  majority exhibit no. .    by mr. noble:  q\tand we have an extra copy for you.\tand we're just  going to skip through some of the meetings and see if there's  anything  a\tsure.  q\t relevant.  a\tand i just want to assure everybody that i was not  filing my nails or having spa treatments in all this black  space.\ti obviously don't look like i was very busy, but  there were a lot of other meetings.  and we also were very mindful of our calendars because  calendar i nforma ti on can obviously be used by outside  parties. meaning russia. you know. kind of any others to kind  of figure out the kind of meetings that they should be  checking for people's communications with.\tso i would also  ask people to be very careful with this.  q\tokay.\twe appreciate that.  unclassified\t let's skip to page .\tit's hill .\tthese are the  entries for april th through may rd, .  a\tapril  to    q\tmay .\tit's page .  a\tyeah.\twe haven't got    oh, yeah.\ti see.  q\tbottom right.  a\tyeah.\ti got it.\tyes.  q\tokay.\tso the meeting on may , i think we talked   about that with    a   q  we did. that was with phil reeker and ambassador    yovanovitch?  a\tcorr ect.\tthat's when she told me that she was  being removed as ambassador.  q\tokay.\tthe next day, on may nd, you had a meeting  with rob blair.    a   q   a   q  a  correct. who is rob blair? he is the deputy to mi ck mulvan ey. do you recall what that meeti ng was about? yes.\tand there was also a meeting with  jrb was,    , you know, ambassador bolton, and then with general kellogg.  they were both to relat e to the m  they were to relate to  all of them my meeting with ambassador yovanovitch and phil  reeker.  unclassified\t  q\tokay.\tand what specifically about ambassador  yovanovitch?  a\thow disturbed i was by what had happened to her,  and i asked if there was anything that we could do.  q\tand what did they say?  a\tthat's when, you know, i mentioned to you that  ambassador bolton, who looked extremely pained, you know,  basically said there was nothing that could be done, but rudy  giuliani was a   q  a  that's the hand grenade comment?  hand grenade, yeah, that's going to blow   everybody up.  q\tokay.\tand who is general kellogg?  a\the is the now national security advisor to the vice  president.\tand general kellogg is the person who hired me  along with k.t. mcfarland and general flynn to work at the  national security council.\the's had a number of positions.  q\twhat was his role at this time?  a\the was the national security advisor to the vice  president.\tand i wanted him to know that this very troubling  development had taken place because, i mentioned before in  the line of questioning, that we were always contemplating:  was there a way that we could get the vice president, you  know, to go to ukraine at an appropriate time?\tand, you  know, we had been, you know, talking about, depending on the  unclassif ied\t  timing of the inauguration or, you know, any of the potential  meetings.  q\tsure.\tlet's talk about that for a second because  there has been public reporting that originally vice  president pence was supposed to attend the inauguration, and  then president trump, at least has been reported, ordered him  not to attend.\tdo you have any knowledge about that and how  that happened?  a\tyeah.\ti already responded to that in regard to  mr. castor's question, and as i said, there was a lot of ii scheduling issues.\tthe vice president can't be out of the  country at the same time as the presi dent.\tand as i  mentioned, i'd already flagged that there were all kinds of  issues swirling around with rudy giu li ani and ukraine and,  you know, the ousting of our ambassador.  and it was going to be very tight fo r the vice presi dent  to make i t for the inauguration.\tso i, you know, have no  knowledge that he was actually ordered not to go, but it was  going to be very difficult for him to go.  q\tokay.\tand   \ta\tand i had already put forward, you know, as i  mentioned before, secretary perry, who i, you know, was  always advocating to go and  you know, go to things like    this.     q\tdid you have conversations with general kellogg      unclassified\t  about your concerns regarding giuliani?  a\ti di d.  q\tokay.\tand was that  is that around this time?  a\tno.\tthis is exactly  that's what i'm saying.  these meeti ngs wi th the three of them, and i know they look  like they were in the same time because they were both very  short with ambassador bolton, and then with kellogg, it was  for somewhat longer because i had already expressed concerns  with ambassador bolton beforehand.  and i wanted to flag for rob blai r , because often  ambassador i al issues come through the chief of staff's  office, and rob blai r i s a, you know, very good professi onal ,  knows fore i gn affai rs, that thi s was all transpiring and that  this was goi ng to have a massive backlash also at the state  department and that it already had, you know, a chi lli ng  effect, you know, with our embassy in kyiv and also among,  you know, many people that we were interacting wi th.  people were shocked.\tthey'd already got word that she'd  been, you know, recalled for or summoned very abruptly for  consultati ons back at home, and she told me at this meeting  here that she'd already been dismissed, and it was looki ng  for a time for her to come back.  q\tokay.\thow did mr. blair respond when you rai sed  these concerns?  a\the said that he would flag this for mi ck and that  unclassified\t he would pay attention to it, for mulvaney.  q\thow about general kellogg?  a\tgeneral kellogg didn't say that he would tell the  vice president, but he said that he would talk to the team.  and i also had jennifer williams, his director who covered  all of europe, who was our counterpart there  i mean,  again, we talked about how small the vice president's team  is  and she was also in the meeting.  so i wanted to make sure that they knew that there were  issues and they should be very careful, you know, so that the  vice president didn't, you know, get mired up in  you know,  i was flagging, you know, in case rudy giuliani or anybody  who's sort of seeking meetings.  we did this frequently.\ti mean, that's what the vice  presi dent's staff would rely on us for sendi ng red flags to  them for, you know, meetings they should avoid or. you know,  kind of things that they should be aware of because they  di dn' t have a big team to be able to track everything.  q\tokay.\tlet's skip to the next page, page , a  meeting on may th with, it looks like, the ukrainian  it  was a ukrainian delegation along with   a\tthere was a ukrainian delegation.\ti can't actually  speak about that one.\tthis was arranged with our  intelligence directorate.  q\tokay.  unclassifi ed\t  a\tand then the secure call with phil reeker was me  following up again on, you know, more of these related  issues.  q\trelating to giuliani?  a\trelated to concerns about ukraine and, you know,  how things were unfold i ng with ambassador yovanovitch.\tbut  also, i mean, as phil reeker was the assistant secretary for  all of europe, we always had a long agenda of items that we  needed to d i scuss about.\tand in this, you know, timeframe  there was also things related to  and you'll see on the  next page  viktor orban, the prime minister of hungary was  coming, and ambassador reeker was in charge of obviously  hungary in his portfolio.\tand we were doing a press  background briefing in this timeframe.\the was doing one, and  i was doing one.\tso all of these issues would have been on  the agenda.  q\tokay.\ton may rd, i t's not on your calendar, but  that's the day of the meeting we've been talking about when  the  a\tthat's right.   q  u.s. delegati on came back.  a yeah.  q did you get a readout from anyone about that  meeting?   a yes.\ti got a readout from charlie kupperman.  unclassified\t  q\the participated in the meeting?  a\the did.  q\tand what did he say happened during that meeting on \tmay rd?  a\the sai d that the other participants had made  i  mean, he obviously wasn't on the delegation  had made a  concerted effort to express  and senator j ohnson can talk  to you about this because he was in that meeting  about  their positive impressions about zelensky, and that ther e had  been a lot of stress on energy reform, and that secretary ii\tperry had been instructed that he had  days to see if we  could make some progress on the energy  reform in the  energy sector.  and, again, this was all consistent with, as i mentioned  before, discussions that we'd been having with our energy  team, i ncludi ng with wells griffith and his staff and many  others, on how we would try to get ukraine more embedded in  eu ropean energy security, not just look to some kind of  object visavis russia or as a transit country for russian  energy, but how we would get ukraine in and of itself in a  better place in terms of its energy diversification and the  restructur i ng of its own energy sector.  q\tare you aware of president trump saying anything in  that meeting along the lines that he believed that ukraine  had tried to bring him down in ?      uncla ssif ied\t  a\tthat was related to me by ambassador volker at a  later point.  q\tokay.\twhat did ambassador volker tell you?  a\the told me exactly that.  q\tokay.\thad you ever heard  did you ever hear that  on any other occasions, president trump expressing belief  that he believed ukraine   a\ti think he said it publicly, bu t definitely  mr. giuliani has said things in that regard . io\tq\tturning to page , on may th, that friday, it  looks like you had a meeting with ambassador taylor   a\tthat's right.  q\t and mr. vindman?  a\tyes.\tand i had a previous meeting with ambassador  taylor on the th.\tso this was when ambassador taylor, on  page , was, you know, basically in the process of  he  wasn't able to go out to the inauguration.\the was in the  process of going out as charge.  and as i mentioned before, i've known ambassador taylor  for decades, and he and i talked, you know, very frequently  about some of the challenges he was going to face in this  position.  and i know he's going to come in and talk to you  him self , but he had made it very clear that if the state  department didn't have his back on this, that he wouldn't  unclassified\t  conti nue in the position.\the was very reluctant to step into  a situation where the previous ambassador had been ousted on  baseless charges.\the was very well aware of all of the  dangers here.  q\tdid that include the dangers of giuliani?  a\tyes.  q\tyeah.\tyou discussed that with ambassador taylor?  a\ti did discuss that with ambassador taylor.\tand,  actually, i ni ti ally, i thought he shouldn't do it.\tand then  over ti me we became, you know, more  we needed ambassador  taylor, fran kly, somebody of his stature.\tand he said that  he had an undertaking from secretary pompeo that they would  have his back and make sure that he wasn't subject to  baseless attacks either from inside of the ukra in e or from  the outside.  q\twhy did you initially think he shouldn't do it?  a\tbecause he was basically taking over what looked at  this point like a tainted, poisoned chalice.\ti mean, if you  have had your previous ambassador ousted on no just cause and  somebody else has to step in and they have to basically clean  up a mess, i mean, would you do that?  q\ti'm not testif yi ng, but    a\tyes.\tbut i think basically most of us would think  twice, three times, four ti mes before agreeing to do thi s.  q\tyeah.\ton page , there's this meeting on the nd  unclassified\t  with amos hochstein.\tis that the meeting that you referred  to earlier?  a\tthat's the meeting that i referred to.\tand i  related to ambassador taylor, who also knows amos hochstein  from the past, what he had told me and suggested that he  should, you know, also talk to him if he wanted to.\tbut  ambassador taylor seemed to know a lot of this information  anyway.\tambassador taylor is extremely well informed, and  he's, you know, kind of never stopped on his keepi ng track of  ukraine, you know, si nce the time that he was an ambassador.  q\tokay.\twhat about this meeting on may  with  kristina  i'm going to  a\tkvien.\tshe is the new dcm, deputy chief of  mission, in uk rai ne.      on  q\tand what was this?\twas this meeting just a briefer   a\tcorrect.  q\t before she went over?  a\tand for us to talk about, you know, kind of policy  issues.\tand i related to her, you know, the hopes that we  \twould be able to focus with the ukrainians on this broader  energy sector reform and how we could work with other  european embassies there, the germans, the poles, the czechs,  the slovaks, you know, not just the usual, you know, suspects  of, you know  we always work obviously with the eu or the  unclassified\t  nato allies in a general sense, but how we could be more  proactive in trying to get the europeans to do more on  ukraine.  and it wasn't just about military issues; it was also  about energy because, you know, the germans  we were in  this spat with the germans about nord stream , but, you  know, the germans also have the wherewithal to help ukraine  refurbish its energy infrastructure and, you know, also to  work with the poles and the czechs and slovaks for bringing  in lng . ii\tand the germans were also at this point talking about  bringing through bremen, and through a new port, lng into  germany that also could come into ukraine i f there was indeed  a building up of the infrastructure in that part of europe.  q\tokay.\ton page ,\twe're moving into early june,  you had a svtc with ambassador volker, it looks like?  a\tyes.\tthat was for him to update the europeans on,  you know, the presidential delegation and some of the next  steps, you know, on  and then, you know, the question still  at this point was, were the russians going to be at all  willing to meet, you know, as we're getting now past the  inauguration of presi dent zelensky, or were we going to have  to wait unt i l the larger electi ons were tak i ng place?  and so this is a kind of occasion where the french and  german counterparts to ambassador volker would relay      unc l ass i f i e d\t  information from meetings that they had participated in.\ti  have to confess, i was only in part of that meeting.  q\tokay.\tthat's okay.\twe don' t need to go into  detail.\tbut i did want to ask you  mr. heck:\t\tyour time has expired.  minority.  dr. hill:\tand just as a note, the alex ukraine thing  after this is to follow up to say, you know, to kind of make  sure that we were, you know, following up on any issues that  would pertain to us in terms of interagency coordination. ii\tso, often, when we had a meeting, i would follow up with  our ukraine director just to make sure that if we had any  doouts that we had to be in charge of  and, you know, at  his level, there's lots of workinglevel meetings that i  don't participate in  just to make sure that everyone is on  the same page.  mr. noble:\tokay.  by mr. castor:  q\tso you told mr. vindman not to go to the debriefing  with the president?  a\twe agreed with charlie kupperman that, given what  i'd just learned about this confusion about kash patel, that  it would not be best.   q  a  what if it was just a mistake? charlie kupperman led me to believe that it  unclassified\t  probably not was a mistake, and he didn't want to get into  personnel issues.  q\tokay.\tso  a\tbut he was clearly concerned by this as well.  q\twhat exactly was the issue?\tit sort of strikes us  as random that now we're talking about kash patel.  a\twell, it was a bit random to me too.\ti'd never  talked to  i would  him, and i told you i didn't have any  meetings with him.\tand suddenly the exec sec, just, you  know, the regular guys, you know, who i'm picking up some  other material for are telling me that the president wants to  meet with this ukrainian director about materials that they  had got from him and, you know, just to have  an alert that  he'd be asking for kash.\tand that's obviously what, you  know, for me  q\tis it possible there was just a mixup, that   a\tit didn't sound like it.\tthat doesn't really  happen.\ti've not had that kind of mixup before.\tit's not  like the names of directors  not everybody knows our  directors.  q\tany other reason the presi den t would know kash   patel?\ti mean, maybe   a\ti couldn't tell you.\ti think you'd have to ask  that yourselves.\ti don't know.  q\tand you have never met mr. patel or you didn't   unclassified\t  a\ti have met him.\ti know what he looks like, and i'd  been in meetings with him.\tbut i'd never had any oneonone  interaction with him, and he'd not been attending any of our  ukraine meetings.\the was on the general distro for his  directorate.\tbut i started to worry that he'd been sending  some of our materials in an unauthorized fashion, so i made  sure that he wasn't on any of our distros that could have  been internally.  q\tdid you communicate your issue with ambassador  bolton?  a\tcharlie kupperman said he would speak to ambassador  bolton about this.  q\tokay.\tand did he ever get back to you about what   the  a   q    he said that he was dealing with it. okay.\tthat's it?\tthat was the end of it?   a\tcharlie kupperman always dealt with issues that you  brought to him, and it was in discussion with him that he  said that he would go in and sit in and give us a readout of  the meeting, because it was another red flag at that point  that something was going on, because kash patel had not been  involved in the inauguration meeting.\tand i never raised  this with kash patel because, again   q\twas this like a widely known fact at nsc?\tit just  seems like a rather random factoid.  unclassified\t  a\twhen i told my office that this was the case, i  said:\thas any of you had any interaction with kash patel?  it alarmed everybody.  q\tright.\tbut now i t's the subject of a q and a being  raised by, you know, congressional staff.\ti mean , how would  that information get to congressional staff?  a\twell, that suggests that charli e kupperman did  indeed raise it with people.   q  a  including congressional staffers? i don't know about that , but he must have raised it   with other people because, you know, how else do you guys get  to know a lot of this stuff?  q\tokay.\tbut you haven 't communi cated that  information  a\ti have not.  q\t  in advance of today, right?    a   q  i have not. and the i nformati on conveyed to the majority has   been equa l i n terms of majority and mi nor it y get the same  information coming from you?  a\ti hav en't spoken to anybody from any of the staff.  q\tokay.\tso this is the first time that you' ve been  here talking   a\tabout?  q\t about these matters?\tyou di dn' t have a     unclassified\t  prebri ef?  a\tthat is cor rect, i did not.  q\tor any pref elt telephone calls?  a\ti did not.  q\tand to your knowledge, there was no proffer raised  by your repr esentat i ve s, whether your attorney or othe rwi se?  a\twhat do you mean a proffer?  q\tproffer is when, you know, an attorney will call  and talk about the testimony tha t his or her client intends  to give.  a\tnot to my knowledge.\talthough, now, what i have to  say is that i've read a lot about my testimony, purp orted  testimony, and as you know , i don't have a written testimony  in the press.  q\tri ght.  a\tso, as i had raised kash patel as a concern in my  directorate and to other people, and i menti oned it to das  kent, deputy assistant secretary kent, and to also ambassador  taylor, and after i'd put it up the chain asking them to be  aware if the re was any communication from kash patel, i can  be, you know, fairly confident that they talked to other  people about this.  q\tokay.\tso it wasn' t a mistake.\tit was something to  be handled, in your view?  a\tcorrect.\tthat's right.  unclassified\t  q\tokay.\tand   a\tand based on my experience of  and a half years at  the national security council, something like this isn't  usually a mistake.\twe had an awful lot of people in the  early stages of the administration doing all kinds of things  that were not in their portfolio.  q\tokay.\tdid you talk with mr. patel's supervisor?  a\ti did not because they were in the moment of a  transition there as well.\tand charlie kupperman was the  person who was dealing with all personnel issues, so i went i i\tto the appropriate channel.  q\tand did he ever  a\ti also was not, you know, at the time, you know,  going to, you know, basically throw mr. patel under anybody's  bus.\ti told charlie kupperman about it, and i said:\ti  barely know kash patel.\ti know what he works on.  but i did go back to my office and, again, flag for the l\tpeople who were working on ukraine that they should just be  alert to make sure that they had no representation from him  and, you know, kind of suggested there may be some  confusion  that i s exactly what i said  from our exec sec  for whatever reason about who is our ukraine director.\tand i  just want to make sure that everyone knows it's alex vindman,  and there is no other ukraine director at the nsc.  q\tokay.\tand vindman wasn't in the may  debrief?      unclassified\t  a\the was not.  q\twas anybody from nsc?  a\tcharlie kupperman.  q\tokay.\tand charlie kupperman di dn 't get back to you  with a result of his  a\the gave me a readout, and i just, you know,  repeated that  q\tno, with the kash patel issue.  a\the did not.\tbut i wouldn' t necessarily have  expected him to, but my experience with charlie kupperman is i i\the always followed up, always, on any issue that i brought to  him.  q\twell, if there's some confusion about somebody  operating in the ukraine policy space   a\tthen he would have dealt with this.  q\t you would think that he would follow up with  you.  a\tfrom what i've heard most recently is that kash  patel has been moved to counterterrorism, where there's not a  lot of terrorism going on in ukraine.  q\tokay.\tbut i guess my point was, if there was an  issue that needed to be deconflicted and mr. kupperman went  and did that but di dn' t come back to you, i mean, what  a\the did not, but, i mean, he would not necessari ly.  if there was any disciplinary or anything else as a result of  unclassified\t  that, he would not come back to me on that.\tthat's a  personnel issue that he would deal with.  q\tdid he indicate to you that he had handled it?  a\the said he would.\the said he would handle it.  q\tokay.\tbut you never had any closed loop   a\ti did not, no.  q\ti'm going to ask you about the politico article  from january th again.  a\tokay.   q  \ta  i just want to warn you in advance. all right.\ti mean, i have to go back and read that    all over again.  q\tand we have copies if anybody wants one.  a\tyou don't work for politico, do you?  q\twhat's that?  a\twell, it's just you're touting this, you know, kind  of politico article.   q\ti'm not touting it.\tno.  this is, you know, a news account.  i'm just  you know, it's rather in depth.   you know, thi s is a reporter that   a\twho's the reporter?\tjog my memory.  q\tmr. vogel, kenneth p. vogel.\tdo you know  mr. vogel?  a\ti mean, i know of him.\ti've seen his bio and other  things.      unclassified\t q\tright.\ti mean, he's gone on to the new york tim es  \tat this point.   and, you know, this article goes through  entreaties to the ukrainian embassy, you   know, here in the united states.\tand mr. vogel interviews  and gets people on the record talki ng about what   was interested in.  and i'm just\tall the guffawing over the veracity of  this article, i'm just   a\tthis is in j anuary , this article.  q\tyes.\tyes.   a  so, remember, i go into the government, into the   administration in april of .  q\tright.  a\tby which time, i receive or when i go in an awful  lot of briefings  q\tright.  a\t from the intell i gence community, and i read all  of the documents pertaining to .\tand i am then in  endless meetings about this to try to push back against the  russians.   q   a  right. and so all of the materials that i have from a   classified context, there is none of that, anything, you  know, related to   q\tokay.\tbut, i mean, it's  you know, reporting is  unclassified\t  a compilation of talking to sources.\tand you' re not saying  the whole story is just  a\tno, i'm not.  q\t outright fabr i cati on, right?  a\tno, i'm not.  q\tokay.\tare you able to characterize what parts of  the story concerns you?  mr. wolosky:\ti mean , we    dr. hill:\ti really  yeah, i'd like to know why we're  doing this.  mr. wolosky:\tjust wait before we get to that.  dr. hill:\tyeah.\tokay.  mr. wolosky:\tyou know, i don't know what document  you're talki ng about.  mr. castor:\tokay.\twe can make an exhibit.  mr. wolosky:\ti haven ' t read it.\tthe witness hasn't  read it.  dr. hill:\twell, i read it a long time ago.  mr. wolosky:\ta long time ago.\tit's not been entered as  an exhibit   mr. castor: i'm going to enter it.  mr. wolosky:\tor offered as an exhibit.\tdo you want  us to sit and read the article?\ti mean we're here.\twe'll do  whatever you want.  mr. castor: this is exhi bi t .      unclassified\t    mr. wolosky:\tif you are going to ask her about, you  know, generally what's accurate and what's not accurate, you  know, why don't you point her to specific portions of the  article.  mr. castor:\tyeah, i'd be happy to.  dr. hill:\tyeah, i remember, i mean, of course, this  article.\tand as i said before, i could give you a long list  of people who were reaching out on all kinds of di fferent  fronts to all of the campaigns, all of the campaigns, from  all kinds of different sources who were trying to do  something like this.  mr. castor:\tso you don't discount the fact that  was probably doing what's reported here?\ti mean,  you're an expert   dr. hill:\tit's not  well, what specifically are we  talking about?  mr . wolosky:\twell, what specifically are you referring  to because we're not going to have her answer  you know,  affirm broad statements:\tis this accurate?\tis this page  article accurate?  dr. hill:\tyeah.\tand i t's also, you know, talking about  people in the ukrainian american community, which is pretty  extensive, people with meetings at the embassy.\tand as you  unclassified\t  know, there were all kinds of peace projects that were being  put around at that time.\ti received about three of them from  different people.  i had people asking to talk to colin powell and would i,  you know, help set things up with that   by mr. castor:  q\tsure.  a\t before, you know, for example, jeb bush, you  know, you name it.\tthere were people coming forward trying  to use any contact that they possibly could to talk to ii\tpeople.\tand there aren't articles about all of them.  so, when i go back to brookings, perhaps i could start  writing a lot of articles about the people i knew previously  in the runup to the  election who were trying to do some  of these thi ngs too.\tit does not amount to a largescale  ukrainian government effort to subvert our elections which is  comparable to anything that the russians did in .  and if we start down this path, not di scount i ng what one  individual or a couple of individuals might have done, ahead  of our  elections. we are setting ourselves up for the  same kind of failures and intelligence failures that we had  before.   q  a  q  okay.\ti  look, and i feel very strongly about thi s. evidently.     u nclassified\t  a\ti'm not trying to mess about here.  q\tevidently you do.  a\tyes, and so you should, too, in ter ms of our  nati onal securi ty.  q\twell, let me help you understand he re.\ti' m trying  to understand:\tis i t the whole thing, everything?  mr. wolosky:\task her a question about a specific thing  of which she has personal knowledge, and she'll respond.  she's not going to respond to an page arti cle based on  some general   mr. castor:\ti'm not aski ng her to respond to an page  article.\ti marked it as an exhi bi t, and we're about to get  into it.  mr. wolosky: well, ask her somethi ng specific, mr.  castor.  dr. hill:\tare you trying to suggest  sorry.\tokay.  mr. wolosky:\tj ust ask her a question, and she will  respond.  by mr. castor:  q\tokay.\tpage two  a\tall\tright.  q\t a uk rai ni an american operative  thi s is the  third paragraph on page two  who was consulting for the  democratic national committee met up wi th top officials of  the ukrainian embassy in washington in an effort to expose  unclassified\t  ties between president trump, top campaign aide paul  manafort, and russia, according to people with knowledge of  the situation.\tthe ukrainian efforts had an impact in the  race helping to force manafort's resignation.  mr. wolosky:\tanswer to the limit of your personal  knowledge that you had.  dr. hill:\twell, this is the conclusion of kenneth vogel   and david stone.    by mr. castor:   q ri ght.\tand so   a this is not the conclusion of the u.s. i ntell i gence  agenci es.  q\tokay.\tso   a\ti cannot make that conclusion just based on that  article ei ther.  q\tokay.  a\tthis is an assertion, the conclusion that the  authors of this article are maki ng.  q\tokay.  a\tnow, should we have been lookin g, all of us,  overall, at every effort to interfere in our election?\tyes,  we should have been.  q\tat my peril, i'm trying to figure out whether this  is just complete fiction that was pitched to a reporter and  has been completely debunked based on information you have or      unclassified\t  whether there's any other explanation for this   a it is a fiction that the ukrainian government was  launching an effort to upend our election, upend our election  to mess with our democratic systems.  q okay. but there could have been some ukrainians  that were interested in injecting information   a and this appears to be a ukrainian american, which  w 're also talking about mr. fruman and mr. parnas are  ukrainian americans who were also trying to subvert our io\tdemocracy and who managed to get one of our ambassadors ii\tsacked.  q on page  is where it starts getting into  leshchenko's involvement. like, what do you know about  leshchenko's efforts to expose the manafort issue?   a   q   a  only what i have read in the press. okay.\tso there is nothing that you have ­ again, this is in january of , and the period   in which i entered into the government and, you know, the  period in which you're working there, we unearthed more and  more information on what the russians were doing.  q\tokay.\ti'm not  a\tand it's not to    q\t  trying to compare what they're doing  a\tyes, but i'm not sure where we're going with this  line of inquiry here    unclassified\t  q\ti'm just asking you about  a\tbecause if you're also trying to peddle an  alternative variation of whether the ukrainians subverted our  election, i don't want to be part of that, and i will not be  part of it.  q\ti'm not trying to peddle anything.\ti'm tryi ng to  ask you about what information you have regarding these.  and, you know, frankly, if we didn't have such a   a\tbut you're asking me about an article that was  written in politico in ja nuary of . ti\tq\tand i probably wouldn't have returned to i t, but it  was just such a passionate rebuke of this article that  just  a\twell, it's of the thrust of the question that  you' re asking here, which is to basically  you know, what  we're dealing with now is a si tuat i on where we are at risk of  saying that everything that happened in  was a result of  ukraine in some fashi on.   q  a  q  yeah, i'm not saying that.\ti'm not  well, that's certainly what it sounds like to me. i'm not going down that path.\ti'm just simply   trying to understand the facts that are discounted  or  recounted in this story.  on page ,\tit talks about the ambassador chaly penning  an oped.\tdo you have any familiarity with the oped that  unclassified\t  the ambassador wrote that was negative to the president, the  president when he was a candidate?  a\tthere were an awful lot of people from every  imaginable country at this particular point trying to game  out where things were going to go in our election.\twe can  find an awful lot  we had to do this, by the way, before  every head of state visit.\twe had to comb through what any  of them might have said in the course of the election  campaign that might be negative toward the president, and  there were an awful lot of people who said negative things.  you might remember a moment in public in the rose garden  with prime minister tsipras of greece, and i got my ass  chewed out for this one afterwards because we hadn't  noticed\tbecause i don't happen to speak greek and di dn' t  have on hand a greekspeaking staff member, but john roberts  of cnn did a gotcha moment for tsipras in public, full  view  i remember it very vividly  pointing out to tsipras  negative things that he had said about the president and how  much he hoped that president trump was not basically elected  during the presidential campaign.  and the president was not at all happy, and the press  staff said to me:\thow could you have missed that?  well, it was all in greek.\tso i presume that cnn has a  whole greek staff on board who are poring over things at, you  know, vast expense.\twell, we don't have lots of  unclassified\t  greekspeaking staff members poring over everything.  so, getting back to this again, many individuals were  trying to game out our political system, many other  governments.\tthe russians are the government that have been  proven from the very top to be targeting our democratic  systems.  q\tokay.\tfair enough.  a\tand i'm sorry to be very passionate, but this is   precisely   q l i\ta  i'm just try i ng to get your  why i joined the administration.\ti di dn 't join   it because i thought the ukrainians had been going after the  president.  q\ti didn't say you di d.\ti' m just tryi ng to get your  reaction to  a\twell, my reaction obviously is pretty strong  because, again   q\ti know.\tit's proven very i nteresti ng.  a\t i'm extremely concerned that this is a rabbit  hole that we're all going to go down in between now and the   election, and it wi ll be to all of our detriment.  q\ti'm just asking you to give your reaction and if  you have any firsthand information given your area of  experti se.  a\tmy firsthand reaction is exactly  of certain  unclassified\t  information  is exactly what i've said, that there may be \t, and i  can name lots of other american citizens with various  appellates to them who were running around trying to do  similar things with similar embassi es.  q\tokay.\tbut you don't have any firsthand information   about ambassador chaly?  a\tit was not.    was that ever a point of discussion? but ambassador chaly was always trying   to obviously push president poroshenko's interest and, you  know, obviously has now been removed by president zelensky. i i\tq\tright.  a\the was the former chief of staff to president   poroshenko.  q\twas president poroshenko, you know, in favor of  hillary clinton over president trump to the extent you know?  a\ti do not know.\ti do know that presi dent poroshenk o  spent an inordinate amount of time in the early stages of the  administration trying to create as good a relationship as he  possibly could with both the vice president and the  president.  q\ton page ,\tukraine's minister of internal affairs,  avakov  a\tmr. avakov, yeah.  q\tyeah.\the had some disparaging remarks about the  president on twitter and facebook.\tdo you have any fi rsthand  unclassified\t  information about that, or can relate any addi ti onal  information?  a\ti can't.\tas i said, we found disparaging remarks  made by pretty much every world leader and official at  different poi nts about the president.\tso, you know, this is  not surprising but, again  you know, and the fact of this  was in the course presumably of the campaign.\tagain, this is \tjanuary of , this article. \tq\tokay.\tand thi s will be my last passage that i \tpoint you to, page , a ukrainian parliamentarian artemenko? ii a\tartemenko.\tyeah, i don't really know him.  q\tit was quoted  you know, it was very clear tha t  they, presuming the poroshenko regime, was supporting hillary  clinton's candidacy.\tthey did everything from organizing  meetings with the clinton team to publicly supporting her to  criticizing trump.\ti think they simply didn't meet  that  is with the trump organization because they thought hillary  would wi n.  a\twell, i think that this is the ki cker here.\tas you  well know and as we all know, th ere was an awful lot of  people who actually thought that secretary clinton would win  the election.\tso an awful lot of countries and individuals  were already preparing for that eventuality by trying to  curry favo r with the campai gn.  q\tokay.      unclassified\t  a\tand certainly, as i said earlier on, before  president trump was selected as the candidate, i mean, if  you're at all interested, at some poi nt, i can sit down with  you privately and go through all of the people i know who  tried to go through every single one of your colleagues'  campaigns from every kind of different people who came up to  us, because i had colleagues who were working on senator  rubie's campaign, on bush's campa i gn, on jeb bush's campaign.  and, believe me, there were ukrainians, ukrainian  americans, russians, all of whom wanted to talk to those ii\tcampaigns too because they didn't think that president trump  would become the candidate.  q\tfair enough.\tyeah.\tand at the end of today, i am  pretty certain you and maybe your lawyer won't want to see me  again, but   a\tno.\tno.\tit's totally fine.\ti'm just trying to  basically say here that i have very  you know, obviously  strong feelings about our national security.\tand i just want  to, if i've done anything, leave a message to you that we  should all be greatly concerned about what the russians  intend to do in .\tand any information that they can  provide, you know, that bas i cally deflects our attention away  from what they did and what they're planning on doi ng is very  useful to them.  q\tthe bottom of exhibit , on each page there's a  unclassified\t  date stamp j uly .  a\tthat was when my assi stant printed it out.\tas you  can be aware, i was not actually there at the time.  q\tand do you have any firsthand information about why  this was printed then?  a\tbecause that was his last day in the office.\tand  before i left, after i'd been in to talk to our legal team, i  asked if i could have a copy of the contacts and the calendar  for reference purposes so that i could help tim morrison with  transition. ii\tand i wasn' t actually able   the contacts is also  datestamped the same time because i wasn't savvy enough to  be able to print it out.\tevery time i printed it, it didn't  print.  q\tfair enough.  and then it was printed  a\tsimple incompetence.  q\tit was printed on the st and then    a\tand he held onto i t. and i picked i t up  q\twhen you came in in september?  a\tbasically, yep.\tmy printer  \tpicked it up from  him, yep.  q\tto the extent that the i nformati on that  mr. giuliani was communicating to the various persons, to the  extent the individuals he was communicating that information  unclassified  to  a\tthat was a lot of us, i think, you know, but anyone  who was watching.  q\t took it at face value   a\tright.  q\t and didn't undertake their own fact checking   a\tright.  q\t or own investigation.\tif they simply took it at  face value, you know, is it fair to say that if people  genuinely believed what was being provided, i mean, is it  fair to say that that could have yielded some of the results  that we saw?  a\twhat results?  mr. wolosky:\ti don't understand.\ttoo much breadth in  that question.\tcould you sort of maybe break it down?  dr. hill:\tyeah.\twhat results?  by mr. castor:  q\twell, some of the results about the in format i on  mr. giuliani was proffering  a\tright.  q\t you testified yielded the unpleasant result of  ambassador yovanovitch being recalled?  a\toh, ambassador yovanovitch being recall ed.\twell,  yes, i f you believe in conspiracy theories and, as you said,  you know , and you don't have any   unclassified\t  q\tright.  a\talternative ways of fact checking or looki ng  into i ssues , if you believe that george soros rules the world  and, you know, basically controls everything, and, you know,  if you  q\twas mr. giuliani pushing that?  a\the mentioned george soros repeatedly, and the hill  article as well did and many others.  q\tbut just the march th hill article?  a\ti think it was the th or something li ke that,  that i saw.  q\tokay.  a\tand i was very sensitized to this i ssue because in  the whole first year at the nsc   q\tri ght.  a\t more people, myself included, were being accused  of being soros moles.\tand, indeed, i'm out on infowars again  with roger stone, alex jones purporting that indeed from the  very beginning i've been involved in a george sorosled  conspiracy.   q   a  okay. so, if you believe things like that, i mean, in   general, and a lot of people seem to do, or some people seem  to do   mr. wolosky:\ti just wanted the record to ref lect that      unclassified\t  mr. castor laughed in response to that question.  mr . castor:\twell, no.\tno.  mr. wolosky:\tlet me finish.\tand this is a very serious  matter, okay.\tthis is a matter where people are being  targeted and people  mr. castor:\tthat is an outrageous  that is outrageous  to say that i laughed at that.  mr. wolosky:\tyou did laugh, and i want the record to  reflect it because this is a very serious matter where  people's lives potentially are in danger.\tand it's not a ii\tlaughing matter.  mr. castor:\tshe di scussed a number of individuals and  situations that i have no familiarity with, and so to the  extent you think that   mr. wolosky:\tand when she mentioned soros and infowars  and the fact that she is now back into that cycle, you  laughed about it.  mr. castor:\ti didn't bring up infowars.  dr. hill:\ti did.\ti did.  mr . wolosky:\tand you laughed.\tso the record will  reflect it.  mr. castor:\twell, that is, you know, an absolutely  ridiculous characterization.  dr. hill:\tlook, i think the unfortunate thi ng that  we're all in at the moment  and as i said, you know, i try  unclassifi ed\t  at all times to, you know, maintain this nonpartisan, you  know, expert approach, but we're in an environment where  people believe an awful lot of things.  i mean, mr. soros and a whole lot of other people were  sent pipe bombs.\ti had a call from one of the detailees from  the fbi who was in my office previously, my previous special  assistant, who told me to seal up my door slot today before i  came down here because he's been following the alt right out   of those  and white supremacists. jo\t\tby mr. castor:  i \tq  a  who was that? my colleague back at the fbi, who was detailed, my   special assistant, and he said i'm lighting up the  twittersphere.  q\tokay.\ti have no   a\ti don't follow all of this stuff, so i have to rely  on other people ti ppi ng me off about this.  q\tokay.\ti know nothing about alex jones or anything  like that.\ti'm simply interested in the hill reporting and,  you know, what lu tsenko may or may not have said to solomon  and  a\tbut it's become part of what's become a very large  universe of information and stories that are out there on the  internet that is really affecting an awful lot of people's  judgment s.      unclassified\t  mr. castor:\tmr. jordan?  mr. jordan:\tokay.\tdr. hill, i just want to go back to  where i was last hour, if i could.\tagain, ambassador  yovanovitch in her statement last week talked about  corruption is not just prevalent in ukraine but is the  system.\tand then along comes this guy, zelensky, who is  running a campaign on  you know, totally on cleaning up the  corruption, i mean, it's a central issue of his campaign, and  wins.\tand my understanding is he won rather big.  dr. hill:\the did win big, yeah. ii mr. jordan:\tbut as you indicated earlier, you still  don' t know.\tyou know, people run campaigns and say things,  and then they get elected and sometimes they do things that  aren't consistent with what they told the voters they were  going to do.  dr. hill:\tright.  mr. jordan:\tso you wanted to wait, see how things  happen in the parliamentary elections   dr. hill:\tyep.  mr. jordan:\tsee how he handled himself.\tand so you  wait and the parliamentary elections go well for his party,  right?  dr. hill:\twell, this happened, you know, in july, \tjuly st, by which i had already left, but that is correct, \tyeah.  unclassified\t  mr. jordan:\tright.\tyou're kind of waiting.\tand you  also said earlier that  i guess you were probably also  waiting to see what happened  what kind of feedback you got  from the folks, secretary perry, senator johnson, who went to  the i naugurat i on, see what th ei r feedback was.\tand my  understanding, that feedback was positive for president  zelensky.  and you testified earlier that   mr. goldman:\tsorry to i nter rupt, but if that's a   you' re nodding, so i just want the record to reflect you're ii\tsaying yes.  dr. hill:\toh, i'm so sorry.\tyes.\ti forgot the  fi rst  yes.\tthat is correct.\tyes.\ti'm sorry.  mr. jordan:\tand then you said earlier that, you know,  mb holds up dollars all the time.  dr. hill:\tuhhuh.  mr. jordan:\tit happened\tin your, you know, extensive  experience, it's happened several times, even happened with  ukraine, right?  dr. hill:\tthat's correct.  mr. jordan:\tyeah.\tand then' in the end' it sort of all  worked out, the j aveli ns happened, the security assistance  dollars happened, continued to flow. and then, when  president trump and president zelensky meet, li ke many people  have told us, it seems to me they actually hit it off when  unclassified\t  they met in new york.  so we've got all this stuff going on, and i get it, and  we've spent several hours talking about it all.\tbut as i  look at it all, in the end, it kind of worked like it  normal ly does.\ti understand there were different people  talking and doing different things, and you talked a lot  about ambassador sondland and mayor giuliani and different  thi ngs.  but in the end, what needed to get done, everything you  have said  you agreed with the javelins going there.\tyou  agreed with the security assistance happening.\tyou felt, i  think, like the rest of the folks that we have spoken to,  that if president zelensky and president trump get together ,  they're actually going to get along.  and you felt that when the senator and the secretary  went there for the inauguration, they liked this guy too.  all that kind of worked out.\tis that fair to say?  dr. hill:\twell, it depends on what you mean about  working out.\tthe president and presi dent zelensky did, in  fact, meet at the u.n. ga.\tthat is corr ect.\tthe military  assistance appears to have been delivered, to the best of my  knowledge and also to yours.  but in terms of the overall u.s.ukrainian relat i onshi p,  no, i wouldn't say that this has worked out because we're in  the middle of now what is a scanda l about ukraine.\tso the  unclassified\t  manner in which we got to this point has been extraordinarily  corrosive, the removal of our ambassador and what we have  done. which is laying open what appears to have been an  effort in which a number of unsanctioned individuals.  including ukrainian american businesspeople. seem to have  been involved in these efforts    mr. jordan:\tdr. hill, why do you think president  zelensky was in favor of a new ambassador to ukraine from the  united states?  dr. hill:\ti only see what i see in the tran scr i pt, in ii\twhich he's talking to the president.\the didn't say that he  was necessarily in favor.\the's just responding to what he  has been told in this transcript.  mr. jordan:\ti mean. i can look at this tran scr i pt  again, but i think he said he favored it  percent.\the was  pretty emphatic about  dr. hill:\the's responding to what the president said,  as far as i can tell here.\ti can't speak to what president  zelensky is thinking.\ti really can' t.  mr. jordan:\tyou think he's simply responding to the  president's suggestion?\tit seems to me, if that was the  case, he would say:\tokay.\ti think tha t would be fi ne.  he says:\tno, i agree with you  percent.\tshe was for  poroshenko.  dr. hill:\the also says that he agrees  percent,  unclassif ied\t  actually , percent, on, you know, angela merkel and other  european countries not helping ukraine, which actually isn't  true.\tit is true, as the president has asserted, that  they're not helping on the military front, but the germans  and the french and other europeans are giving an awful lot of  technical assistance and funding and money to europe.\twe  were trying to get them to do more, but i t's not true that  they're not doing much.  look, i can't speak to what either of the presidents  were thinking in this moment.\ti can only read and respond to  the transcript.  mr. jordan:\twell, okay, fine.\ti mean, we have what  president zelensky said.\the obviously wanted a new  ambassador just like president trump did.  dr. hill:\twell, he doesn't say he wanted a new  ambassador here.\the wants his own new ambassador.\tpresident  zelensky also removed ambassador chaly because he's newly  elected, and ambassador chaly used to be presi dent  poroshenko's national security advisor and special assistant,  special diplomatic advisor.  mr. jordan:\ti'm just readi ng what president zelensky  sai d.\ti agree with you  percent  page four, second  paragraph, president zelensky, near the bottom:\ti agree with  you  percent.\ther attitude towards me was far from the  best as she admired the previous presi dent and she was on his  unclassified\t  side.  dr. hill:\tlook, i can't speculate about why president  zelensky was saying this and about what he was thinking about  at this parti cular time.\the also doesn't have her name  correct.  mr. jordan:\tyou don't think   dr. hill:\tand he says:\tit was great that you were the  first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador.  he said:\tit was great that you were the first one who jo\ttold me that she was a bad ambassador.  mr. jordan:\ti unde rstand.\ti'm not saying  dr. hill:\tno.\tbut i'm just saying that this seems to  suggest somethi ng else, so perhaps all of us shouldn ' t be  speculating on wha t they were basi cally both thi nki ng or  saying.  mr. j ordan:\ti'm not speculating.\ti'm just saying what  he said.\ti'm asking you  dr. hill:\twell, he says:\tit was great that you were  the fi rst one   the fi rst one  who told me that she was a  bad ambassador because i agree with you  percent.  that doesn' t mean to say that he thinks that she was a  bad ambassador.\the's responding to what the president has  said to him .  mr. j ordan:\tso, when he said, i agree with you   percent, he's not agreei ng with the president  percent?  unclassified\t  dr. hill:\twell, he's agreeing with the presi dent  \tpercent if\tthe president has told him that she is a bad  ambassador, as the first one who i s telling him.  mr. jordan:\tall i'm    dr. hill:\ti'm just saying to you what i'm readi ng here  as well.\tand, look, i don't want to start parsing what  either the president is saying or president zelensky  mr. jordan:\ti d i dn't posit why he wanted her.\ti just  said what he said.\tyou're the expert on ukraine, not me.  dr. hill:\tlook  ii\tmr. jordan:\ti'm asking you what you think ­  dr. hill:\ti am saying that he   mr. jordan:\twhy did president zelensky, the guy who  ran on corruption, the single bi ggest issue, that was his  campaign, he wins, he gets elected .\the wins the  parliamentary races, and he says  he wins overwhelming in  his presidential election, he says he wants a new ambassador.  i'm just asking you   dr. hill:\tyou'll actually see here that ther e's an  error in translat i on here.\tso, remember, president zelensky  doesn't really speak english.\the speaks some english but not  a lot of english.\ti would like to actually know whether this  was, you know, fully interpreted or whether he himself was  attempting to speak in english for this because you'l l  actually see i t's quite garbled.      unclassified\t  so, if you start to actually look at this paragraph  here, and i worked as a translator as well , as an  interpreter, just to be clear here, and i do speak ukrainian,  although not as well as i speak russian, and what he's saying  here is he has got confused between the ambassador to the  united states from ukraine, which could, in actual fact, be  his ambassador, the ukrainian ambassador to the united  states.\tso he's getting himself confused in this particular  point here. io\tmr. jordan:\twhat was her name  or his name, excuse  me?  dr. hil l:\tthat's ambassador chaly.\tbut you see, he  says here:\tit'd be very helpful for the investigation to  make sure that we administer justice in our country with  regard to the ambassador to the united states from ukraine.  so that's already a confusion.  mr. jordan:\twell, but he didn't say   dr. hill:\tso what i' m saying here is  he d i dn 't , but  he's getting confused.  mr. jordan:\the said yovanovitch.  dr. hill:\tyes, but as i say, he's getting confused  because he's talking about the ambassador to the united  states from ukra i ne.  mr. jordan:\tokay.\tfine.  dr. hill:\tso what i'm saying here is, and then he said:  unclassified\t  it was great that you were the first one who told me   the  first one who told me\tthat she was a bad ambassador  because i agree with you  percent.\tand then he says her · \tattitude to me was far from the best as she admired the  previous president and she was on his side.  and this is what we understand as being said by rudy  giuliani.\tbecause i know from working with ambassador  yovanovitch that she wasn't personally close to poroshenko.  mr. jordan:\tdr. hill, that is fine.  dr. hill:\tand let me just tell you this, there's been  two i nstances  just let me finish  there's been two  instances in which ambassadors have been refused agrement or  been refused consideration by the countries because they've  been accused of being close to the previous incumbent  president.  this happened with our ambassador to georgia, and she'd  been previously serving in the embassy in georgia under  saakashvili, and the curren t president said that she was  close to him and purported to provide information to me and  to others, and this wasn't true.\tagain, as i've said before,  anyone who had worked with presi dent poroshenko   mr. jordan:\tdoctor, i'm not asking about georgi a.\ti' m  asking about ukraine.  dr. hill:\tno.\tbut i'm pointing out to you that this is  a common refrain that we get from other embassies in other  unclassified\t  countries when they don't necessarily, you know, want to  ei ther have an ambassador that we're try i ng to send to them  or that they want to curry favor with many of our officials.  they wi ll often refer to things like this.  mr. jordan:\tall right.\tthank you.  mr. zeldin:\tdr. hill, do you have a relationship with  former assi stant secretary of state victoria nuland?  dr. hill:\tin what way, a relati onshi p?  mr. zeldin:\tprofessi onal.  dr. hill:\ta professional relationship, yes, when i was ii\tworking in the previous capacities as the national  intelligence officer.\tshe's a longterm, you know, forei gn  service officer.\tshe'd been the national security advisor to  cheney, for example, to vice president cheney at that ti me.  i do not have a personal relati onshi p wi th her beyond the  professional relat i onshi p.  mr. zeldin:\tare you aware of her directing anyone at  state to talk to christopher steele during her tenure as  assistant secretary?  dr. hill:\ti was aware from the exchanges that she asked  kathy kavalec to talk to him after we had thi s discussion  already, when i suppose chr i stopher steele had asked to talk  to her, and she asked kathy kavalec to talk to him i nstead.  mr. zeldin:\tin your opinion, would that be proper?  dr. hill:\ti wouldn' t have talked to him in that  unclassified\t  position, but whether it's proper or not, i think, is a  judgment for assistant secretary nuland and others.  mr. zeldin:\tthis was in the midst of the  election,  correct?  dr. hill:\ti believe that's the case.\ti mean, i read  about this later, and kathy kavalec told me that she'd been  instructed to go and talk to him.  mr. zeldin:\thas anything been stated so far today that  you would describe as classified, or would you say everything  up to this point is unclassified?  dr. hill:\ti don't think that anything that i have said  is classified.\tor are you referring to just questions that  you have asked?\ti mean, i think that when we've got i nto   and this is why, you know, perhaps i've been a little harsher  in my responses to the questions about the politico piece and  things about ukraine because i have a lot of classified  information that leads in other directions, and, obviously, i  can't share those.               unclassified\t    by mr. goldman:  q\tbut would all of that information flow ultimately  through you on up the chain?  a\tnormally.\tthat's why it attracted my attenti on.  and it's also because the exec sec staff member clearly  thought that this was reporting through me.  q\tright.\tbut i'm just trying to understand that.  even if he were to have had some sort of involvement with  ukra i ne from another directorate, that it still, ultimately, ii\tin normal channels, will get funneled up through you, on up  the chain  a\tnormally .\talthough, you know, i' m sure   \tand others will, you know, recall those often  jurisdictional spats between directorates, parti cular ly if  something was overlapping.  thi s happened repeatedly with ct, or the  counterterrorism directorate, that they felt that they ought  to have, you know, for example, the direct reporting on an  issue that fell into their purview.  and we had a few disputes sometimes between some of our  directors and the ct directors about who had responsibility,  you know, for a particular issue.  q\tbut you knew what they were doing on those  d i sputes.  unclassified\t  a\ti did know what they were doing, correct.  q\tso can you give us an assessment of how unusual it  was that, as you understood i t, someone outside of your  directorate was providing information to the president about  ukraine?\thad that happened about any of your countries that  you oversaw in your / years there?  a\tyeah , i think  you know, normally, there was  also, you know, a very extensive clearance process.\tso  anything that was. going to the president would have been, you  know, fully vetted and cleared, you know, across the nsc  directorate if there'd been a request.\tand, normal ly , the  request would've come through ambassador bolton.  q\tand let me ask you something else.\tif something  were to come through other channels, related to ukraine, on  up through charlie kupperman or ambassador bolton, would you  have expected them to loop you in on it and ask you about it?  a\ti think i t would depend on the nature of the  material.\ti mean, if it fell into the purview of, say, our  cyber and it might have been, you know, relat ed to something  that was classi fi ed and that, you know, perhaps i was not  read into, then, you know, i t's possible that i would not  necessari ly have known about that.\tbut, in this case, this  seemed to be talking about some routine mater i als.  q\tand just to be clear, this was   a\tand, again, i did not want to put the exec sec  unclassified\t  person, who was totally a staff member, in a difficult  position.\tthey  q\tunderstood.  a\t clearly were just relating to me thi s request or  just thinking that i already knew and were giving me a  headsup.  q\trelating the request from the president?  a\tthat they just were, you know, ki nd of  i think  they thought they were remindin g me that the president, you  know, wanted to speak to the ukraine director about the  materials.   q   a  okay. and just to give me a headsup and to say that, you   know, they might be contacting kash.\tand that's when,  obviously, i thought, whoa, okay.     he  q\twhen you mentioned this to charlie kupperman, did    a   q   a  q  he was surprised. i was going to say, did he know about this at all? he did not. okay.\tdid he indicate to you whether he understood   that ambassador bolton knew of this at all?  a\the indicated that ambassador bolton did not know  about this as well.\the acted very surprised.  q\tand that seems   is that outside of the normal  unclassified\t  operating procedures within the national security council?  a\tyes.\tthis was unusual, which is why i flagged it.  q\tokay.  a\ti mean, there have been cases of, you know, general  mistaken identity, you know, in the past tha t have been not  particularly a big deal.\tbut this is, of course, happening  in this context in which all kinds of other things are going  on as well.  q\tand just to be clear, you don't believe this is a jo\tcase of mistaken identity.  a\tno.\ti\tmean, it was clear  i\tmean, kash is not a  usual name.\tand kash is not alex.  q\toh.  a\ti mean. it wasn't clear to me. though. that  everybody in exec sec would know who alex vindman was anyway.  i mean, yes. he'd been on the delega ti on as a representative,  but he wasn't, you know, someone who was particularly  wellknown.  q\tduring your plus years there, how frequently did  the president ask to meet with any directors on any of the  countries that you oversaw?  a\tnot on any of my countries, he had not.  q\tnever.  a\the had not.\tbut i t's possible that he had asked  for other people.\ti mean, we had people with, you know,  unclassified\t  various specific areas of expertise on other issues that he  could easily have asked for and i wouldn't know about that.  but he had not on any of my  other staff members at  high levels would request a director to attend a meeting, you  know, given the serious nature of meetings, and a number of  our directors di d go to, you know, highlevel meeti ngs and  sit in with them.\tand, often, if i wasn't there, one of our  directors would go.   q   a  but not the president? they might be there in the context of a   presidential head of state meeting if i\t  q\tsorry.\ti just meant the president had never    a   q  no.  specifically requested    a\tnever.  q\t a director within any of your portfolios.  a\tnot in my portfolio, he had not.  q\tokay.\tand did you\ti would imagine it was  relatively important for you to understand what information  the president was reviewing related to ukraine, given that  that's part of your portfolio.   a that's correct, which is why i took it to charlie  kupperman.   q and did you ever figure out what it was?  a i did not.  unclassif ied\t  q\tafter having brought it the first tim e, did you go  back and make a subsequent request, given the importance for  you to understand what the president was seeing related to  ukraine?  a\twell, i started to be concerned around this, that  then it was obviously, you know, material that was not part  of the national security process.\tand if  q\twhat do you mean by that?  a\twell, obv i ously , it wasn't related to the isues  that we were working on.\tit had to be something else.\tand i i\tthen, you know, as i expressed  charlie had already  i'd  already expressed to charlie kupperman my concerns about the  giu li an i accusati ons, and i had no idea whether this was  relat ed to this or to any other i ssue.\tagain, i don't want  to speculate.\tbut i was confident that if i needed to know  what this was, charlie kupperman would tell me and would   i nform me.  q\tand he did not.  a\the did not.  q\tare you aware of whether kash patel ever met with   rudy giuliani?  a\ti do not know.  q\thow about with mick mulvaney?   a  q  i don't know that either. and ambassador sondland?      unclassified\t    a q i also don't know that. and so, after that initial conversation with  charlie kupperman, you heard nothing else about this?  a i, at one point later on, asked charlie kupperman,  you know, what was generally going on with kash patel, and he  told me that he was going to be transferred to  counterterrorism.  q\tand did you understand that there was a reason for  that? io\ta\ti inferred from that that it was to  basically in ii\tresponse to what had happened.   q  a  was that perceived\thow was that in response? he said to me that that was more fitting with the   issues that he was interested in, that patel was interested  in.\ti mean, again, look, these are personnel matters.  that's   q  a  right.  normally handled by charlie kupperman.\tand kash   patel was not in my directorate.\tand i flagged my concern.  i also did not want to start, you know, jumping down the  throat of the exec sec staff person, who clearly had just  told me something that they did not realize, you know, i did  not know.\tand i immediately went upstairs to flag it.  q\tare you aware of whether any other united states  government officials ever engaged any ukrainian officials in      unclassified\t  any way to request that they initiate these investigations  that rudy giuliani was  and president trump referenced on  the ju ly th call?  a\ti'm not aware of that, no.  q\tokay.\tare you aware whether any congressmen or  senators were i nvolved at all in this effort?  a\ti'm not.\ti mean, i've only read, you know, what's  been reported in the press most recently about some of the  i nvolvemen t including congressman sessions.\ti was surpr i sed.   q related to parnas and fruman?   a correct.\tand ambassador yovanovitch. i mean, i  did not expect that that was. you know, the originating  source for the pressure against her.  q\tuhhuh.  and is there anything more about mr. mulvaney's role in  this whole ukraine issue in connection with. you know,  mr. giuliani's efforts?  a\tnot beyond what i've already told you.  q\tokay.  you, obviously, left july th.\tand you' ve exhaustively  \tanswered our quest i ons today, and we are very appreciative of  that.\tyou've mentioned repeatedly concerns that you had  about, in particular. mr. giuliani and his efforts.  when you read the call transcript of july th, the call  record , which you must have done just a couple weeks ago, did      unclassified\t  it crystallize in your head in any way a better understanding  of what was transpiring while you were there?  a\tin terms of providing, you know, more information  with hindsight, unfort unately, yes.  q\tand in what way?  a\tthe specific references, also juxtaposed with the  release of the text messages by ambassador volker  you  know, what i said before  really was kind of my worst fears  and nightmares, in term s of, you know, there bei ng some kind  of effort not just to subvert the national security process,  but to try to subvert what really should be, you know, kind  of, a diplomatic effort to, you know, kind of, set up a  presidential meeting.  q\tthis may   a\tthere seems to be an awful lot of people involved  in, you know, basically turning a white house meeting into  some kind of asset.  q\twhat do you mean by asset?  a\twell, something that was being, you know, dangled  out to the ukra i ni an government.\tthey wanted the white house  meeting very much.\tand this was kind of laying out that it  wasn't just a question of scheduli ng or having, you know, the  national security issues worked out, that there were all of  these alterna te discussions going on behind.  q\tand you have discussed the july th meeting where      un class i f i e d\t  ambassador sondland indicated that.\twe've gone through the  kurt volker text on july th.\tyou've now read the  transcript of the presidential call between president trump  and president zelensky.  would you agree this doesn't seem to be a oneoff; this  seemed to be a fairly considered campaign over a period of    time?    a\twell, it certainly dovetails with the activity that   we started to see after the ouster of marie yovanovitch, of  masha yovanovitch.\tso, for me, masha yovanovitch's ouster ii\twas some kind of tipping point or turning point.   q   a  and this wasn't  because it was after she was removed from her   position that you started to see, you know, more of this  activity.  q\tand, even then, i believe you said that you  understood, at least from ambassador yovanovitch, that she  was told that the president had ordered her removal.\tis that  right?  a\tshe didn't tell me that at the time when i saw  her   q  a  i'm sorry.  may st.\tshe was being discreet, but she told   me that there had been a lack or a loss of confidence in her  position and that, although they told her that she wasn't  unclassified\t being removed for cause, her position was no longer  tenable  q\tbut  a\t and that she had wrap up her  she stated this  in her public testimony.  q\tright.\tand deputy secretary sullivan told you,  though, that the state department was quite supportive of her  and it had nothing to do with her work performance.   a   q  ii\ta  that's correct. so  and i was also surprised to read in her public   testimony that there'd been a pressure campaign, that she'd  been told there was a pressure campaign going back to the  summer of .  q\tokay.\twell, rudy giuliani doesn't have the  authority to remove the ambassador, correct?   a   q  i don't believe that he does.\tthat's correct. right.\tso did you i nfer at the time who made the   decision to remove her?  a\ti actually inferred at the time that it had been  made at the top of the state department  q\tso you think it was secretary pompeo?  a\tin response to, you know, obviously, concerns  that had been raised against her which one could trace right  back to what mr. giuliani had been saying and he had been  unclassified\t  building up into a crescendo of criticism about her in that  period.  q\tand now having read the call transcr i pt, do you  have a different view of what occurred?  a\twell   q\tthe call record.  a\twell, based on what i read in the transcript and  what she said in he r testimony, which was obviously told to  her, then i have a different view  well, i have the view  that we're now discussing, that the president asked for her  to be removed.  q\tokay.  and i don't mean to belabor thi s, but rudy giuliani was  not a government official.\tand so, did you have an  understanding of for whom he was acting on behalf of?  a\ti did not, actually.\ti mean, i was often worried,  in listening to him, that he was acting on his own behalf.  q\tright.\tnow, i'm sort of saying, now that you're  looking back at the text messages, the call record, and  putting it together with all the meetings and other  i ntera cti ons that you saw   a\ti still have questions of whether he was acting on  his own behalf , par ti cula rly after the indictment of  mr. parnas and mr. fruman.  q\tunderstood.\tbut do    unclassified\t  a\ti think   q\t you also understand that the president adopted a  lot of rudy giuliani 's views, to the extent they are rudy  giuliani's?  a\twell, given the drumbeat of rudy giuliani 's views  on the television, i think if you listen to that long enough,  you know, it kind of  god knows what anybody would think,  getting back to, you know, questions that have been posed  before.\the seemed to be, you know, basically engaged in a io\tconcerted effort to propagate these views.  q\tuhhuh.  a\tbut i cannot say that this was  all of the things  that he was doing was at the direction of the president.\ti  can't say that.  q\tbut you did notice in the call transcript that the  president said several times that president zelensky should  speak with rudy giuliani, right?  a\ti did.  q\tso did that give you an understanding   a\tbut that suggests that rudy giuliani has all of the  information.\ti mean, again, he's being directed to talk to  rudy giuliani.\tand, you know, when we refer to the ellipses,  you know, the president isn't laying out in full all of these  issues.\tso, you know, kind of, a lot of this information is  coming from rudy giuliani, and rudy giuliani seems to be, in  unclassified\t  some fashion, orchestrating a lot of these discussions.  q\tif ukraine actually did initiate these  investigations, who would they have benefited?  a\twell, they might have benefited mr. giuliani and  his business colleagues just as much as anyone else.  q\thow so?\tan investigation into joe biden, how would  that have helped   a\tit's an investigation, but it wasn' t just into  that.\tthere was investigations writ large.\tso if there's  upheaval in the ukrainian energy sector and people are ii\tremoved , perhaps this gives the opportunity for these  individuals and other individuals to get investments or  lucrative board posi ti ons.  q\tdid president trump mention the energy sector or  corruption in the energy sector in the july th call?  a\the doesn' t seem to have done so.\ti mean , he refers  to dir ectly , as i stated  but, overall, we were  again,  there have been lots of references to energy sector and to  corruption in the energy sector.\tand, technically, burisma  is part of the energy sector in ukraine.  q\tright.\tbut you understood  as we discussed, you  understand rudy giuliani and, clearly, presi dent trump' s view  of the burisma to the extent that they wanted an  investigation related to the bidens?  a\ti see what was in the tran scri pt , but i'm also  unclassified\t  referring to all of the discussions that were out there in  public on the television and all the statements by  mr. giuliani.\tthey seemed to cover a lot of ground and a lot  of territory.\ti think i t's entirely possible  and, again,  i'm presuming that thi s is what you're all trying to get to  the bottom of  that many things were bei ng put onto this  set of issues.\tthis is   q\tso i t's not just one thing.    a   q  this is a bund li ng of a number of i ssues. so am i correct in understanding that there could   be a number of different i nterests that are   a\tmy view, in looking at this, is tha t individuals,  private individuals, like mr. gi uli ani and his business  associates, are trying to appropriate presi denti al power or  the authority of the president, given the position that  mr. giuliani is in, to also pursue their own personal  interests.  q\tbut the president was willing to provide the  presidential power in that july th call.  a\twell, that's the july th call , but before that it  seems to me that there was a lot of usurpation of that power.  q\tbut you do agree that in that july th call the  president was   a  q  that's what it seems to suggest. okay.  unclassifie d\t  a\tand, again, i' m reading that in a context in which,  you know, i've been looking at other information\tand i  don't have a complete picture of what transpired between when  i left and when the call was made  and then subsequently to  all the information that we're seeing out in the press as  well.\ti'm learning things from the press, if indeed all of  this is accurate, for the first time.  q\tright.\ti understand that.  and i guess the final question i have is, you indicated  earlier on today that this was sort of your worst nightmare  and that these requests for investigations appear to be  political in nature .\tis that accurate?  a\tcorrect.\tmy worst nightmare is the politicization  of the relationship between the u.s. and ukraine and, also,  the usurpation of authorities, you know, for other people's  personal vested interests.  q\tright.\tbut whose  a\tand there seems to be a large range of people who  were looki ng for these opportunities here.  q\tif the ukraine  i think you used this term  dug  up dirt on joe biden, whose political prospects would that  assist?  a\twell, depending on how it plays out, that could   assist a wide range of people.  q\tpotentially.\tis it going to assist rudy giuliani 's  unclassified\t  poli ti cal campaign, or is it going to assist presi dent  trump' s?  a\twell, again, it depends on how thi s all plays out.  at this part i cular  look, this is now, kind of  eve rybody  could be damaged by all of this, which basi cally gets back to  my poi nt.\teverybody's campaign could be severely damaged by  how this plays out now.\tor it could be benefited.  i\tthink what you're saying is, was the intent to promote  the campaign of president trump.\tyes.\tbut you're asking the  question, also, about how this mi ght play out. ii\tq\tthat was rea lly just the former, but i\tunderstand  what you'r e saying.  can i have  mi nute?  all ri ght.\ti\tthink we're done here.\ti\tdon't know if  you guys have anything.  mr. castor:\twho was the staffer i n the exec sec that  brought up kash patel?  dr. hill:\tiill be honest, i actually can't remember.  mr. castor:\tokay.  dr. hill:\tbecause it was one of the front offi ce    mr. castor:\tthank you.  dr. hill:\t  staff, and it wasn' t someone who  \tit was  just simply they were relaying to me a piece of  mr. castor:\tthank you.  dr. hill:\t i nformat i on. and i honestly can't  unclassified\t rememb er.  mr. jordan:\tdoctor, who's on this distribution list  that you reference?\ti don' t know how that operates and how  that works.  dr. hill:\twell, i t's usually for, you know, meetings  related to ukraine.\tso if we're having one of these  i ntera gency meetings at the directors level or, you know,  kind of, a political coordination committee, you would add on  everybody who you thought would be, you know, related to this  in some way.  mr. jor dan:\tand would the individuals   dr. hill:\tso i asked them to parse through and see, you  know, what individuals were on and then to see what it would  be about followon mater i als.  so, just to be kind of clear about this, i mean, a lot  of these distribution lists are on our classi fi ed system, not  just on our unclass system.\tand sometim es they have attached  to them a lot of background materials.  mr. jordan:\tthat was my next question.  dr. hill:\tand this gets back to our, you know, concerns  about leaking in the past.\ti mean, you asked me about this  question about cnn.\tjust an enormous amount of our material,  befor·e you've even had a meeting, is out on cnn or politico  or buzzfeed.\tand i would lose my mind, someti mes, before  routi ne meeti ngs by the fact that, before i'd even started  unclassified\t  the meeting, some of the background material with some of the  deliberations already seemed to be somebody publishing it.  mr. jordan:\tyeah.\tno, i' ve   dr. hill:\tso, you know. i mean, obviously, you' ve been  fami li ar with that, and i'm sure it's an occupational hazard  for people here as well.  mr. jordan:\tit sure is.  dr. hill:\tso i started to worry about, you know, kind  of:\twere materials that were just meant for the interagency,  you know, for people, that were deliberative drafts of, you ii\tknow, policy memorandum going backwards and forwards, you  know, that weren't intended for, you know, kind of, other  people, being distributed or information that was attached to  that?  but, in actual fact, when i looked at this, there'd been  very little information that we'd been sending out that  wasn' t, you know, kind of, fairly routine in these documents.  mr. jordan:\tokay.\tthat was my question.\tso the  distribution list is not just to individuals tell i ng them  about a schedule or a meeting.\tit's also some material that  is actually being transmitted  dr. hill:\tthat's r i ght. that they need to use to  prepare for the   and, often, it would be sent, you know, to  individuals in different directorates to prepare their senior  director or themselves, if they were just attending, you  unclassified\t  know, to basically, like we're doing here, you know,  exhibit a, the politico thing, or the transcr i pt, for  example.  mr. jordan:\tright.\tand was mr. patel on the  distribution list that was receiving this information?  dr. hil l:\tin some cases, he was on the larger  distributive list for his di rectorat e.  mr. jordan:\tokay.  dr. hill:\tand, in some cases, he was there with a few  other people from his dir ectorate, perhaps because , again, if ii\tsome of the meetings overlapped with things that he was  working on, or there had also been a lot of changeover,  again, in the dir ectorate , so there were sometimes just two  or three directors   mr. jordan:\tso was he getting the information that   he was getting the same information that everyone else was  getting?  dr. hill:\tfrom what i'm recalling, i think that was the  case.  mr. jordan:\tokay.\tso just like everyone else on the  distribution list, he was getting that   dr. hill:\tthat ' s r i ght .  mr. j ordan:\texact same i nformat i on  dr. hill:\tand, as i said, i went  mr. jordan:\tat the exact same time in the  unclassified\t  meetings  dr. hill:\tcorrect.  mr. jordan:\t everything the same?  dr. hill:\tbut as you're looking back, you know, over   and i'm looking back on my schedule, there weren't a lot of  other  there weren' t a lot of meetings taken, but there's a  lot of background materials.\tso i also wanted to know from  alex and others if there was some other distro list that they  had for other communications for materials.\tbasically, you  know, directors often have their own distro people that ii\tthey're working with.  mr. jordan:\ti guess my concern was, you said  i think  a li ttler earlier you said you were concerned about the  material he may have and may present to whomever he was  presenting it to in whatever meeting.\tand i'm just trying to  figure out, if he's on this same distribution list and he's  getting it just like everyone else and he's getting the same  material, why would you be concerned about the material he'd  be presenting in april, may   dr. hill:\twell, because i wasn't sure  when they  referred to materials, i thought, what on earth materials  could they be talking about?\tso i wanted to see, is there  any way that any of these background materials that were  being prepared  updates on ukraine, in other words   could've been in the mix and then were being given off to  uncla ss ified\t  exec sec?\tbecause they weren't being prepared for the exec  sec or to be handed on, certainly, to the presi den t.\ti mean,  it would do something in a totally different nature if you're  preparing a background briefing for the president or a  background briefing for ambassador bolton.\tthey do it in a  very different way, if i'm preparing a background briefing    mr. jordan:\tokay.  dr. hill:\t for a routine directors meeting, which  might have, you know, all of the comments of the directors,  you know, back and forth  mr. jor dan:\tyeah.  dr. hill:\tand i thought to myself, you know, what   mater i als could this be?  mr. jordan:\tyeah.\tso, just to be clear, though,  mr. patel is on the same distribution list as everyone else  on the list and getting the same material.  dr. hill:\tthat's correct.  mr. j ordan:\tokay.  dr. hill:\tbut then again, i'm trying to figure out, why  would that mat er i al and what could that material be that   could be getting  mr. jordan:\tthank you.  dr. hill:\t  you know, sent up to the president?  mr. zeldin:\tthe next piece of evidence   what's the  next number?  unclassified\t  dr. hill:\tand, again, just to be very clear, i did not  know what that mat eri al would be.\ti did not know at any  time, i was not told, what that mate ri al was that was sent to  the president.  mr. j ordan:\ti wasn't asking about that.\ti was asking  about what was sent to mr. patel was exactly what everyone  else was getting.  dr. hill:\tthat's correct.  mr. j ordan:\tgot i t.    mr. zeldin:\tdr. hi ll , we're passing around exhi bi t  no. .\tthis is  i'll wait for a second until it gets  distributed.  thi s i s.a may th, , letter sent to mr. lutsenko  from three democratic united states senators.\tare you  familiar wi th this letter?  dr. hill:\ti'm not, actually.  mr. zeldin:\tyou have never seen this letter before?  dr. hill:\ti don't beli eve that i have, no.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.\tthis is a letter that three  democratic uni ted states senators sent to the prosecutor  general at the time in ukraine, demand i ng that ukra i ne assist  with the robert mueller probe targeting the president.  dr. hill:\twas this letter made public?\twas it sent to  unclassified\t  the nsc and the public offices?  mr. zeldin:\ti don't know the distro of the letter,  which is  dr. hill:\tright.\tbecause i   mr. zeldin:  one of the reasons why i wanted to ask.  dr. hill:\t have not seen this letter before.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.  did any of the people in the nsc ever articulate to you  any antitrump poli ti cal positions?  dr. hill:\tthey did not, no. ii\tmr. zeldin:\tdo you believe that it was appropriate for  the clinton campaign and the dnc to hire christopher steele  to create the dossier against the trump campaign?  dr. hill:\tas i understand, they di dn't hire him  directly.\ti don't have any personal knowledge about how he  was hired.\ti don't know that he was hired directly by the  dnc.\twas he?  mr. zeldin:\twell, they hired a law firm, fusion gps.  it was through an intermediary, but the money originated from  the clinton campaign and dnc.  but if you're not familiar with the source of fund i ng ,  let's put that aside.  dr. hill:\tno, i'm not.\ti'm not fam il i ar wi th that.  mr. zeldin:\tfunding aside, do you think it is  appropriate for christopher steele to have been hired as a  unclassified\t  foreign spy to be collecting information from foreign  governments to gain an advantage against the trump campaign?  dr. hill:\twell, he's a former foreign spy.\tbut,  nonetheless, a foreign national.\ti don't believe i t's  appropriate for him to have been hired to do this.\tand,  again, i think i already expressed my shock and surprise when  i learned that he had been involved in this.  mr. zeldin:\twe've spoken about burisma a lot today.  are you familiar with the fact that hunter biden was paid for i o\tthi s position with burisma? ii dr. hill:\ti remember seeing the reports about this when  he was first taken onboard.\ti was still at the brookings  institution, and i remember there were press reports about  this.  mr. zeldin:\thas his employment with burisma come up at  all in any of your official government positions?  dr. hill:\tit did not, apart from the discussion with  amos hochstein where he informed me that some of these  discussions in ukraine were centered around burisma, and he  reminded me that burisma was the company that hunter biden  sat on the board of.\tand, as you may also recall, amos  hochstein had expressed concern about that when that  appointment went through in the course of his own official  duties.  mr. zeldin:\tdo you know hunter biden?  unclassified\t  dr. hill:\ti do not.  mr. zeldin:\tare you aware of any experience or  qualifications that he would have for that position?  dr. hill:\ti am not aware.\ti don't know him.  mr. zeldin: and you worked with vice president joe  biden at all in any of your official capacities?  dr. hill:\twhen i was the national intelligence officer  for russia and eurasia in the first year of the obama  administration, yes, i mean, in the same context as i worked  with vice president cheney for the  years of the bush ii\tadministration that i was nio.\ti was often asked to do  bri efin gs.  mr. zeldin:\twhen did your offi ci al interactions with  vice president biden end?  dr. hill:\tin november of  when i returned to  brookings after spending my time as the national intelligence  officer.  mr. zeldin:\tso the remainder of the obama  administration you were out of the united states government.  dr. hill:\tthat's cor rect.\ti was, as an expert, i nvi ted  to a couple of dinner briefings on russia hosted by vice  president biden, but that's the totality of my interactions.  mr. zeldin:\tit's been widely reported that he doesn't  have ukraine experience, he doesn't have energy experience   dr. hill:\twho are we referring to?  unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\thunter biden.  dr. hill:\toh, hunter biden.  mr. zeldin:\tsorr y.\thunter biden  dr. hill:\tyeah.  mr. zeldin:\t it's been widely reported he doesn't  have any energy experience, doesn't have any ukraine  experience, but was hired by buri sma, which is a  let me  digress a minute.  from your knowledge of burisma, are they a corrupt  company? ii\tdr. hill:\ti don't know a lot about burisma, i'll be  frank.  mr. zeldin:\tare you familiar with zlochevsky?  dr. hill:\ti'm not very familiar with him either, just  more in a general sense.  mr. zeldin:\tare you familiar with the in vesti gati ons  into burisma or zlochevsky?  dr. hill:\ti was aware that there were investigations  underway, yes.  mr. zeldin:\tand these were corruption i nvesti gati ons  into burisma and zlochevsky?  dr. hill:\tand into the particular individual.\tso,  again, the fact that there is investigations into corruption  in the energy sector in ukraine, as well as russia or many  other countries, is not a surprise.      unclass ifie d\t  and, also, on thi s point, i have to also say there were  an awful lot of people with poli ti cal connections and not  expert i se on particular issues that were being hired by all  kinds of enti ti es.  mr. zeldin:\tit's been widely reported, as i started to  state, with regards to a lack of energy experience   dr. hill:\tright.  mr. zeldin:\t with a lack of ukraine experience, he  was paid at least $, a month.\tthere are reports that  his company\the has a partner  were paid a substantially ii\thigher figure.  vice presi dent joe biden was the point man for the obama  admi ni strati on wi th ukrai ne.\tbeing the point man for the  obama admi ni strati on, what power comes with that, as far as  purs estri ngs, as far as funding that united states provi des  to ukraine?  dr. hill:\tthe vice president d i dn 't have a role in  that.\ti mean, this is, again, the det ermi nat i on of congress  and also of the state department and defense department and  others.\ti mean, the vice president has no role in  determining the pursestrings.\tthe office of management and  budget do as well.  mr. zeldin:\tare you fam il i ar  dr. hill:\tand vice president pence also wanted to play  a role on ukrain e in this admi nistrat i on.      unclassified\t  mr. zeldin:\tto that point, are you familiar with a  video from january  where vice president biden spoke  about his efforts to have prosecutor general shokin fired?  have you seen that video?  dr. hill:\ti have not seen that vi deo.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.\tthat video  i won't ask a question  directly to that.\ti'll ask a different question.\tbut for  background, that video, vice president biden is speaking  about his efforts, threatening ukraine with the loss of  $ billion if they didn't fire shokin, and then they ii\tinstantly fired shokin.  but the question is, you're saying that the vice  president doesn't have the ability to be delegated any  authority from a president to make those types of threats?  dr. hill:\tto make those types of threats?\tyou were  talking about money earlier.  mr. zeldin:\tdoes a vice president have the power to  make a threat to a foreign government of the loss of united  states support?  dr. hill:\tif he is being asked to do that on the behalf  of the government, on behalf of the president or the state  department and others.  so, when i was working in the bush admi nistrat i on, vice  president cheney was the heavy on all of these issues.\tand  he certainly issued plenty of threats to a whole range of      unclassified\t  countries, including russia, that, you know, i was privy to,  at the direction or the request of other parts of the  government.  so i think, you know, putting forward the idea that, you  know, there could be forfeited an assistance and that vice  president biden was conveying that information on behalf of  the government, well, yes, of course, he could do that.\tbut  he does not make the determination about funding.  mr. zeldin:\tdo you have any concerns about any member  of the united states government being delegated the authority  to make a threat if their son is receiving $, a month  from  dr. hill:\ti think you might be   mr. zeldin:\t a company targeted by an open    dr. hill:\t starting to go into some very dangerous  territory   mr. zeldin:\ti'm sorry.\tlet me finish the question.  dr. hill:\t at the moment for everybody.  mr. zeldin: i'm sorry.\tdo you think that it would be  appropriate for a  do you have any concern with a vice  president being delegated the authority to make a threat like  that if their son is receiving $, a month from an entity  of that foreign country being targeted by having an open  investigation?  dr. hill:\ti think that there is a problem with  unclassified\t  perceptions of conflicts of interest and ethics for any child  of any senior official to be involved in anything that their  parents are involved in, period.\tso this goes not just to  hunt er biden and vice president biden but across the board .  and i think, getting back to the question that  congressman raskin asked about before about corruption and  perceptions of it, this is exactly the problem we have right  now in our politics.\tthe rank and file have to sign all  kinds of ethical agreements to make sure that members of our  family are not involved in anything that we are involved in ii\tor to recuse ourselves.  and across the board, members of congress, the senate, i  mean, this is what you spend your time looking at.\tvice  presidents, presidents, secretaries of state, secretaries of  commerce, secretaries of transportation, secretaries of  interior  i could just go on  should not have their  children involved in anything that they're involved in as  well.  and that's why i'm saying it's a dangerous territory,  because i'm not going to start on giving the long list of  things that i personally think are a real problem.  mr. zeldin:\tthere was an open investigation into  burisma at the time of that trip that vice president biden  made to ukraine and that president trump was concerned with.  are you aware of that?  unclassified\t  mr. goldman:\tdo you have any support   dr. hill:\ti wasn't aware of the information too.\ti  wasn't in the government.  mr. wolosky:\tcongressman, she wasn't in the governm ent.  dr. hill:\tno, and i'm  mr. zeldin:\tactually, the question was  i'm sorry.  excuse me.\tthe question was, are you aware of that?\tand if  the answer is no, then   dr. hil l:\tthe answer is no.\tbecause i'm also not aware  of all of this timeline, in terms of the issues that you' re ii\traising here.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.  dr. hill:\ti was not  i will be, you know, quite open.  i was not monitoring and following exactly what vice  president biden and hunter biden were doing in this time  period.  mr. zeldin:\twell, let me ask you what you do know.  with regards to burisma, do you know when that investigation  was closed?  dr. hill:\ti do not.\tand as i said, when amos hochstein  came in to talk to me again about this and mentioned buri sma,  i had to get him to remind me again about why burisma was  significant.\tin the back of my mind, i knew that there was  some issue with burisma, but it had not come up, up until  then, at any point in the work that i was doing in the  unclassified\t  administration.  mr. zeldin:\tokay.\tdo you know if the case against  burisma was closed at any time?  dr. hill:\tfrom what i have read and been told, that the  case was closed or dropped or that the case stopped.  mr. zeldin:\twhat do you know about when that case  was  dr. hill:\ti don't know when that was stopped.\ti mean,  again, i'll just say that i had to be reminded by amos  hochstein about why burisma was significant.\ti remembered, ii\tfrom when i was at the brookings insti tut i on, reading about  hunter biden being appointed, thi nki ng this was not a bright  idea, and then i did not continue to follow this issue for a  long period of time.  so it came up again in the context of all the things  that we're discussing basically around the ti me that masha  yovanovitch was removed from he r position.\tmy knowledge is  more general, about the state of the uk rai ni an energy sector.  my knowledge in depth is really about russia and russia's  energy sector.  mr. zeldin:\tare you aware of the case  the criminal  i nvesti gati on against zlochevsky?  dr. hil :\ti was aware that there had been one.\tbut,  again, i di dn't ask for any details of this in the position  that i was in, because it did not seem relevant to the work      unclassified\t that we were doing.  and, again, in the nsc, my job was to coordinate.\tand  the real action was being taken , in terms of our ukrainian  policy and implementation, by the state department, the  emba ssy, the defense department, and the department of   energy .  mr. castor:\ti think we're all done.  dr. hill:\tyou're sure?  mr. castor:\tthank you so much.  dr. hill:\tyou don't want to continue? i i\tmr. goldman:\tdr. hi ll, on behalf of chairman schiff,  i'd just like to thank you again for coming in and answering  all of our questi ons.  dr. hill:\tthank you.\tthank you.  mr. goldman:\twe are adjourned.
