3 THE CHAIRMAN:	Let's come to order.	Good morning, Ms. Croft,
4 and welcome the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,
5 which, along with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees, is
6 conducting this investigation as part of the official impeachment
7 inquiry of the House of Representatives.	Today's deposition is being
8 conducted as part of the impeachment inquiry.	In light of attempts
9 by the Department of State and the administration to direct you not
10 to cooperate with the inquiry, the committee had no choice but to compel
11 your appearance today.
12 We thank you for complying with the dually authorized
13 congressional subpoena, as other current and former officials from
14 across the Federal Government have done.
15 Ms. Croft is a career Foreign Service officer.	In relevant
16 parts, she has served on the U.S. Mission to NATO as Ukraine desk
17 officer, at the National Security Council as Ukraine director, and most
18 recently, she currently serves as the special adviser for Ukraine
19 negotiations.	Ms. Croft, thank you for your service.
20 We look forward to your testimony today, including your knowledge
21 of and involvement in key policy discussions, meetings, and decisions
22 on Ukraine that relate directly to areas under investigation by the
23 committees.	This includes developments related to the recall of
24 Ambassador Yovanovitch; the President's July 25, 2019 call with the
25 Ukrainian President Zelensky; as well as the documentary record that

6
UNCLASSIFIED


1 has come to light about efforts before and after the call to get the
2 Ukrainians to announce publicly investigations into two areas
3 President Trump asked President Zelensky to pursue, the Bidens and
4 Burisma, and the conspiracy theory about Ukraine's purported
5 interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.
6 We will also have questions about the Department's response to
7 the impeachment inquiry, including the committee's subpoena, which the
8 Department continues to defy, despite the fact that we know that it
9 has already collected significant documentary evidence that goes to
10 the heart of our inquiry.
11 Finally, to restate what I and others have emphasized in other
12 interviews, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat of
13 reprisal, or attempt to retaliate against any U.S. Government official
14 for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your
15 colleagues.	It is disturbing that the State Department, in
16 coordination with the White House, has sought to prohibit Department
17 employees from cooperating with inquiry and with Congress, and have
18 tried to limit what they can say.
19 This is unacceptable.	Thankfully, consummate public servants
20 like you have demonstrated remarkable courage in coming forward to
21 testify and tell the truth.
22 Before I turn to the committee counsel to begin the interview,
23 I invite Ranking Member Nunes to make any opening remarks.
24 MR. NUNES:	I thank the gentleman.	Welcome, Ms. Croft, for being
25 here.	Hopefully, today's an improvement over yesterday, that won't




7
UNCLASSIFIED


1 be any coaching of the witnesses, or sidebars, with the witness'
2 attorneys, and then interrupting the questions that we have on our side.
3 That's what occurred yesterday, Ms. Croft, and for your counsel.
4 We don't tend to accept that as a proper way of a functioning interview.
5 It's not how it should go.	We'd appreciate it if the majority would
6 not interrupt our side.	And if this continues, I can tell you that
7 my colleagues that are not allowed in this room will continue to express
8 frustration, as we had last week when we - - when this room and the entire
9 committee is continually being bombarded with unclassified material,
10 people want to come down here.	It's not appropriate to have these
11 hearings down in the Intelligence Committee.	This is not an
12 Intelligence Committee matter.
13 And in fact, the only piece of the Intelligence Committee matter
14 that we actually had in jurisdiction we had in this, was the
15 whistleblower, who only the majority and their staff have met with.
16 And so, it's quite concerning this inquisition is going on down here.
17 We don't really want to be part of the cult, but we have no options,
18 so we are here.	So hopefully today, Ms. Croft, you will be able to
19 answer all of our questions.	With that, I will yield the chairman.
20 THE CHAIRMAN:	I thank the gentleman for his opening statement.
21 Mr. Goldman, you are recognized.
22 MR. GOLDMAN:	This is a deposition of Catherine Croft,
23 conducted by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
24 pursuant to the impeachment inquiry announced by the Speaker of the
25 House on September 24, 2019.

UNCLASSIFIED


1 Ms. Croft, could you please state your full name and spell your
2 last name for the record, and if you could just pull the microphone
3 close to you.	It remains on, and you can just speak normally.

4 MS. CROFT:	Catherine Croft, the last name, C-r-o-f-t.
5 MR. GOLDMAN:	So if I could just ask you to lift the microphone

6 a little and pull it a little bit closer and then --
7 MS. CROFT:	Is that better?


8 MR. GOLDMAN:
9 MS. CROFT:
10 MR. GOLDMAN:

Yes.
Okay.	Catherine Croft, the last name, C-r-o-f-t.
Thank you.	Along with other proceedings and


11 furtherance of the inquiry to date, this deposition is part of a joint
12 investigation lead by the Intelligence Committee, in coordination with
13 the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform.	In the
14 room today are majority staff and minority staff from all three
15 committees and this will be a staff-led deposition.	Members, of
16 course, may ask questions during their allotted time as has been the
17 case in every deposition since the inception of this investigation.
18 My name is Daniel Goldman, I'm the director of investigations for
19 the Intelligence Committee's majority staff, and I want to thank you
20 again for coming in today.
21 Let me do some brief introductions.	To my right here is Nicolas
22 Mitchell, senior investigative counsel for the Intelligence Committee.
23 Mr. Mitchell and I will be conducting most of the interview for the
24 majority.	And now, I'll let my minority counterparts introduce
25 themselves.

7 MR. GOLDMAN:	This deposition will be conducted entirely at the
8 unclassified level.	However, the deposition is being conducted in
9 HPSCI's secure spaces and in the presence of staff with appropriate
10 security clearances.	And we understand that your attorneys also have
11 their security clearance.	It is the committee's expectation that
12 neither questions asked of you, nor answers provided by you, will
13 require discussion of any information that is currently, or at any
14 point, could be properly classified under Executive Order 13526.	You
15 are reminded that EO 13526 states that, quote, "In no case shall
16 information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified,
17 or fail to be declassified," unquote, for the purpose of concealing
18 any violations of law, or preventing embarrassment of any person or
19 entity.
20 If any of our questions, however, can only be answered with
21 classified information, please inform us of that fact before you answer
22 the question, and we can adjust accordingly.
23 Today's deposition is not being taken in executive session, but
24 because of the sensitive and confidential nature of some of the topics
25 and materials that will be discussed, access to the transcript of the

10
UNCLASSIFIED


1 deposition will be limited to the three committees in attendance.
2 Under the House deposition rules, no Member of Congress nor any
3 staff member can discuss the substance of the testimony that you provide
4 today.	You and your attorney will have an opportunity to review the
5 transcript after today's deposition.
6 Before we begin, I'd like to go over some ground rules.	We will
7 be following the House regulations for depositions, which we have
8 previously provided to your counsel.	The deposition will proceed as
9 follows:	The majority will be given 1 hour to ask questions, then the
10 minority will be given 1 hour.	Thereafter, we will alternate back and
11 forth between majority and minority in 45-minute rounds until
12 questioning is complete.	We will take periodic brakes, but if you need
13 a break at any time, please let us know.
14 Under the deposition rules, counsel for other persons or
15 government agencies may not attend.	You are permitted to have an
16 attorney present during this deposition and I see that you have brought
17 two.	At this time, if counsel could please state their appearance for
18 the record.
19 MR. MACDOUGALL:	Mark MacDougall, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and
20 Feld, Washington, D.C.
21 MS. McNAUGHTON:	Abbey McNaughton, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer
22 and Feld, Washington, D.C.
23 MR. GOLDMAN:	There is a stenographer taking down everything that
24 is said here today in order to make a written record of the deposition.
25 For that record to be clear, please wait until each question is




11
UNCLASSIFIED


1 completed before you begin your answer, and we will wait until you
2 finish your response before asking the next question.
3 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal answers such as shaking
4 your head, so it is important that you answer each question with an
5 audible verbal answer.
6 We ask that you give complete replies to questions based on your
7 best recollection.	If a question is unclear, or you are uncertain in
8 your response, please let us know.	And if you do not know the answer
9 to a question or cannot remember, simply say so.
10 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege
11 recognized by the committee.	If you refuse to answer a question on
12 the basis of privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition,
13 or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objections.	If the chair
14 overrules any such objection, you are required to answer the question.
15 Finally, you are reminded it is unlawful to deliberately provide
16 false information to Members of Congress or staff.	It is imperative
17 that you not only answers our questions truthfully, but that you give
18 full and complete answers to all questions asked of you.	Omissions
19	may be also considered as false statements.
20 Now as this deposition is under oath, Ms. Croft, will you please
21 stand and raise your right-hand to be sworn.
22 Do you swear that your testimony provided here today will be the
23 whole truth and nothing but the truth?
24 MS. CROFT:	I do.
25 MR. GOLDMAN:	Let the record reflect that the witness has been





12
UNCLASSIFIED


1 sworn.
2 Now, Ms. Croft, if you have an opening statement or your attorney
3 has any matters to discuss, now is the time.
4 MR. MACDOUGALL:	Mr. Chairman, thank you so much.	Before Ms.
5 Croft begins her testimony, I would like to make a brief statement for
6 the record.	Catherine Croft is a career Foreign Service officer
7 currently working as special adviser for Ukraine negotiations.	On
8	October 28th, 2019, Ms. Croft received a letter through her lawyers
9 from Under Secretary of State Brian Bulatao, in which we were instructed
10 that Ms. Croft cannot participate in the impeachment inquiry being
11 conducted by the House of Representatives and these committees.
12 Under Secretary Bulatao's letter stated that these instructions
13 were issued pursuant to a directive from the Office of White House
14 Counsel.	Nonetheless, Ms. Croft has been served with a valid subpoena,
15 and so she is obliged to be here today.
16 While Ms. Croft is prepared to respond to all of the committee's
17 questions to the best of her ability, I need to address one
18 consideration at the outset.	A great deal of attention has been
19 directed to the information submitted to the Office of the Inspector
20 General of the Intelligence Committee by an unnamed government employee
21 pursuant to the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.
22 Ms. Croft is not the whistleblower.
23 As the committee's well aware, the governing statute permits
24 whistleblowers to preserve their anonymity.	We believe that Ms. Croft
25 is obligated to respect in her testimony today the legal standards and




13
UNCLASSIFIED


1 equities that protect whistleblower anonymity in the Intelligence
2 Community.	So the extent we reasonably conclude that any questions
3 directed to Ms. Croft this morning are intended to assist anyone in
4 establishing the identity of the whistleblower, we will make the
5 necessary objections and give the witness appropriate instructions.
6 With that, Ms. Croft has a brief opening statement.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	If I could, Counsel, before the opening statement.
8 None of the members of this committee or staff should ethically seek
9 to out the whistleblower through this witness' testimony.	We will not
10 countenance any effort to do so.	And if you or your client believe
11 questions are directed in that manner, you should object.	We will
12 certainly not the require the witness to answer questions that would
13 violate the whistleblower's right of anonymity.
14 MR. MACDOUGALL:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
15 MS. CROFT:	Thank you for the opportunity to provide my statement
16 today.	For the last 9 years it has been my honor to serve my country
17 as a Foreign Service officer.	In that capacity, it has been a privilege
18 to serve along colleagues of intelligence, integrity, and
19 determination to advance U.S. interests, some of whom have already
20 spoken to this committee.	I'm not sure that I have anything to add
21 to the testimony of those who came before me, but I will answer your
22 questions to the best of ability.
23 My work on Ukraine started in 2013 when I was posted to the U.S.
24 mission to NATO.	My portfolio included Ukraine -- NATO-Ukraine
25 relations when the citizens of Ukraine took to the streets to demand

14
UNCLASSIFIED


1 a European future and an end to corruption.	When Russian tanks rolled
2 into Crimea, I was assigned to NATO headquarters in Brussels.	At that
3 time, we did not know where the tanks would stop.	Russia's aggression
4 in Ukraine posed, and continues to pose, a real and immediate threat
5 to our national interests and a Europe free, whole and at peace.
6 My firm belief in the importance of Ukraine's future to U.S.
7 national interests led me to the Ukraine desk.	From August 2015 to
8	July 2017, I was one of several Ukraine desk officers at the State
9 Department headquarters.	In my portfolio, I focused on security
10 assistance, arm sales, and defense reform.	But like all desk officers,
11 my work also included supporting efforts to combat corruption in
12 Ukraine, and holding leader accountable for lack of high level
13 prosecutions.
14 In July 2017, as the Trump administration was considering
15 overturning the ban on providing Ukraine defensive weapons I was asked
16 to join the National Security Council staff at the White House.	As
17 the director covering Ukraine, I staffed the President's December 2017
18 decision to provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missile systems.
19 I also staffed to September 2017 meeting with then-President Poroshenko
20 on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly.	Throughout both, I heard,
21 directly and indirectly, President Trump describe Ukraine as a corrupt
22 country.
23 During my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist
24 Robert Livingston who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be
25 fired.	He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as a, quote, "Obama

15
UNCLASSIFIED


1 holdover," end quote, and associated with George Soros.	It was not
2 clear to me at the time, or now, at whose direction or at whose expense
3 Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.
4 I documented these calls and told my boss, Fiona Hill, and George
5 Kent, who was in Kyiv at the time, I am not aware of any action that
6 was taken in response.	I left the NSC in July 2018, and started
7 studying Arabic at the Foreign Service Institute in preparation for
8 a tour in Baghdad.	That plan was cut short in May 2019 when I was asked
9 to take over as Ambassador Volker's adviser.	I spent the month of June
10 embedded in our embassy in Kyiv to prepare, and then spent the week
11 of July 8th overlapping with my predecessor, Christopher Anderson.
12 That week was the first time I became aware that are Ambassador Volker
13 was in touch with Rudolph Giuliani.	However, Ambassador Volker's
14 conversations with Giuliani were separate from my work and I was
15 generally unaware of when they spoke or what they spoke about.	I have
16 never had any contact with Rudolph Giuliani.
17 On July 18 I participated in a sub PCC video conference where an
18 0MB representative reported that the White House chief of staff, Mick
19 Mulvaney, had placed an informal hold on security assistance to
20 Ukraine.	The only reason given was that the order came at the direction
21 of the President.	I had heard about the hold before that date, but
22 I do not remember the specific date.	During the July 25 phone call
23 between President Trump and President Zelensky, I was traveling with
24 Ambassador Volker in Kyiv.	I did not listen in on the call.	I
25 accompanied Ambassador Volker in meetings with Ukraine officials, and

16
UNCLASSIFIED


1 to the line of contact between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian-led
2 forces in eastern Ukraine.
3 The only readout I got of the July 25 call was based on what
4 President Zelensky told Ambassadors Volker, Taylor, and Sandland about
5 the call at a meeting on July 26th.	The focus of the call, as I
6 understood it, was to schedule a face-to-face meeting between President
7 Trump and President Zelensky.	We hope that such a meeting would help
8 undue President Trump's long-held view of Ukraine as a corrupt country.
9 Since July, my sole focus has been supporting efforts to resolve
10 the conflict in eastern Ukraine.	Zelensky's election and his mandate
11 to tackle corruption ignited a new energy and to stall talks.	Right
12 now, even as Ukrainians face casualties nearly every day in defense
13 of their own territory against Russian aggression, decide they are
14 making progress in disengaging at key crossing points.
15 Zelensky has shown a willingness to take political risk to bring
16 Russia back to the table.	His best chance at success is with our
17 support, along with our European partners.	It is my hope that even
18 as this committee's process plays out, we do not lose sight of what
19 is happening in Ukraine, and its great promise as a prosperous and
20 democratic member of the European Community.
21 Thank you for the opportunity to speak, and I welcome your
22 questions.

23 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Goldman is recognized for 1 hour.
24 EXAMINATION
25 BY MR. GOLDMAN:

17
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.	Ms. Croft, welcome again.	So just
2 so we're clear about your background, you were at the - - on the Ukraine
3 desk at the State Department in D.C. here from 2015 to July 2017.	Is
4 that right?
5 A	That's correct.
6 Q	So if you want to just pull the microphone toward you and
7 leave it on, then you can just and it will be easier.
8 THE CHAIRMAN:	It will be pointed right at your mouth, it will
9 be picked up.
10 MR. GOLDMAN:	It is for the folks in the back.


11

12 Q

BY MR. GOLDMAN:
And then July 2017 to July 2018 you were the Ukraine director


13 at the National Security Council?


14 A

15 Q

That's correct.
From July 2018 until May 2019, what, if anything, did you


16 have to do with Ukraine?


17 A

18 Q

Nothing in any official capacity.
Did you still maintain an interest and keep up to date on


19 what was going on?

20 A	Yes.
21 Q	How come?
22 A	I had been working on Ukraine for several years.	I was

23 interested as a foreign policy professional, and I remained friends
24 with those who work in the field.
25 Q	And who did you speak to in order to keep up to date on what

18
UNCLASSIFIED


1 was happening with Ukraine?
2 A	I followed closely on Twitter, which is a pretty good source
3 of information.	And I remained in contact with my predecessor, Chris
4 Anderson.	I remained in contact with friends that were serving on the
5 Ukraine desk at the State Department; and I remained in touch with my
6 colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy, my Ukrainian colleagues.
7 Q	You said in your opening statement -- let me ask you this:
8 How aware were you in real time of the issues that arose in March and
9	April of this year with Ambassador Yovanovitch?
10 A	To the extent those events were reported in the media, I was
11 tracking that.
12 Q	Did you speak to anybody at the State Department about what
13 was going on?
14 A	Not that I recall.


15 Q

16 A

Did you speak to Ambassador Yovanovitch?
I sent her one email just telling her I was sorry for what


17 was happening.
18 Q	And you said in your opening statement that when you were
19 at the NSC, you received some messages that were critical of Ambassador
20 Yovanovitch.	Is that right?


21 A

22 Q

23 A

24 Q

25 A

That's correct.
From Bob Livingston.	Is that right? That's correct.
And who is Bob Livingston?
I had never met Bob Livingston, I understood him to being




19
UNCLASSIFIED


1 a lobbyist.

2 Q	Prior to being a lobbyist, do you know what he did?
3 A	By virtue of googling, I did, yes.
4 Q	And what was that?
5 A	That he had served in Congress.
6 Q	And do you recall when he first contacted you?
7 A	Not specifically, no.
8 Q	And how many times did you hear from him?

9 A	I can say with certainty at least twice, but I believe more
10 times than that.


11 Q

12 A

What exactly do you recall him saying to you?
As I reported in my opening statement, I recall him saying


13 that she had to go, she should be fired, that she was an Obama holdover,
14 and made mention of her somehow being connected with George Soros.
15 Q	Other than being an Obama holdover, or an alleged connection
16 do George Soros, did he -- did he mention anything about her
17 performance, or any positions that she had taken?
18 A	I don't specifically recall.


19 Q

20 A

Anything else you can remember about what he had said to you? Not without looking at the notes that I took

21 contemporaneously but no longer have access to.
22 Q	And what did you do after he -- after you spoke to him?
23 A	I reported the conversations both to my then-boss Fiona Hill,
24 and then to George Kent who was then deputy chief of mission at our
25 embassy in Kyiv.

20
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	What was their reaction?
2 A	They were, I think, dismayed at the maligning of her

3 character, but no direct action was taken that I was aware of.
4 Q	You had -- you knew Ambassador Yovanovitch from your work
5 on the Ukraine desk?

6 A	Yes.
7 Q	And at the NSC?
8 A	That's correct.
9 Q	And what was your assessment of her competence and

10 capabilities as a diplomat?
11 A	I assessed her to be an extraordinarily competent and
12 skillful diplomat, and a pleasure to work for and with.
13 Q	What did you understand the allegations about
14 George -- related to George Soros to be?
15 A	At the time, conspiracy theories were floating in the media
16 about George Soros, including allegations that Fiona Hill was
17 affiliated, in some fashion, with George Soros.	So I understood this
18 to be part of a broader narrative used to malign public officials that
19 somebody of some interest disagreed with.
20 Q	And you indicated the conspiracy theory.	Did you understand
21 that there was any validity to any of the concerns that Mr. Livingston
22 raised?


23 A

24 Q

Not that I was aware of, no.
Did you receive any other complaints about Ambassador


25 Yovanovitch while you were at the National Security Council?

21
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	Not that I can specifically recall without reviewing my notes
2 from the time.
3	Q	Do you know if there were any other complaints made by anyone
4	else or to anyone else?	Did you hear anything about that?
5 A	Not that I can specifically recall right now.
6 Q	Were you aware of a letter written by Representative Pete
7 Sessions in the middle of 2018?
8 A	I don't have a recollection of that letter right now.
9	Q	Why are you smiling?
10 A	Because I simply don't remember it.	It	seems like I should,
11 but I don't.
12 Q	Okay.	So, you said that you were following the issues
13 related to Ambassador Yovanovitch earlier this year from the media?
14 A	That's correct.
15 Q	And based on your knowledge and expertise about Ukraine and
16 your working relationship with Ambassador Yovanovitch, were you aware
17 of any factual basis for any of the allegations that were made against
18 her?
19 A	No.
20 Q	Now, you said in your opening statement that you were - - that
21 you staffed President Trump's meeting with President Poroshenko in
22	September 2017.	Was that right?
23 A	That's correct.
24 Q	And you said that President Trump had concerns that Ukraine
25 was a corrupt country at the time?

22
UNCLASSIFIED



1AYes.2QCan you explain a little bit more about what his concerns3were?4AThe President, at the time, didn't elaborate what his own
5 concerns were.	He just simply described Ukraine as corrupt.
6 Q	And based on your experience working Ukraine issues, did you
7 also believe that in the past, Ukraine had been -- had suffered from
8 serious corruption?
9 A	Yes.	I think it was well-known that there was a lot of
10 corruption among senior leadership in Kyiv.
11 Q	In fact, U.S. official policy towards Ukraine has been - - one
12 significant aspect of U.S. official policy related to Ukraine has been
13 to stamp out corruption.	Is that right?
14 A	That's correct.
15 Q	You said you were also involved in the decision to provide
16 Javelins to Ukraine at the end of 2017.	Is that right?


17 A

18 Q

Yes.
And that was a significant endeavor to provide lethal


19 defensive assistance to Ukraine in their war to fend off its aggression
20 from Russia.	Is that right?


21 A

22 Q

Yes, that was a very significant policy change.
When was the -- when were the Javelins ultimately approved


23 to be provided to Ukraine.	Do you recall with any specificity?


24 A

25 Q

That was in December of 2017.
And at that time, when were they supposed to be delivered?

23
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	The decision did not include a specific delivery date
2 that	because that requires planning and, you know, moving equipment
3 around and things like that.	So until we had the decision, we weren't
4 able to physically move the equipment or anticipate a deployment date.
5 Q	Soon after the decision was made, was there a plan put in
6 place about the timing of the delivery?
7 A	Yes.


8 Q

9 A

10 Q

And do you recall the first target date? I don't recall.
Do you recall if there were ever any delays related to


11 providing the Javelins to Ukraine?
12 A	From the date of the President's decision to the delivery,
13 no I'm not aware of any delays.
14 Q	Are you aware of -- so when, ultimately, were the Javelins
15 provided?	Do you recall?


16 A

17 Q

I don't recall the specific date, no.
If -- would it -- if I told you there's been some reporting


18 that it was towards the end of March of 2018, would that sound correct
19 to you?
20 A	That sounds -- that sounds reasonable, yeah.
21 Q	Were you also aware, at that time as Ukraine director, that
22 Ukraine somewhat suddenly ceased to cooperate with the Special
23 Counsel's investigation?


24 A

25 Q

I'm sorry.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller?

24
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	Can you repeat the question?
2 Q	Around that same time, March, April, 2018, there was
3 reporting that Ukraine stopped -- announced that they were going to
4 stop cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
5 Were you aware of that?
6 A	No.
7 Q	You were on the National Security Council as Ukraine director
8 at that time?
9 A	Yes.	I don't have any specific memory of any conversations
10 with Ukrainians about the Mueller investigation, or participation or
11 cooperation.


12 Q

13 A

14 Q

15 A

Did you read it in the press?
I imagine I would have at the time.
You just don't remember it sitting here today? I do not.

16 Q	Understood.
17 Let's move ahead to 2019, we'll go back.	So the one other
18 question I had on Ambassador Yovanovitch:	When did you hear that she
19 was going to be recalled from Kyiv?

20AI would have read it in the news along with everybody else.21QDid you have any conversations with George Kent or anyone22 else at the State Department about the allegations against Ambassador
23 Yovanovitch?


24 A
25 Q

Other than what was in my opening statement, no. And so you only followed it from the media?

25
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	That's correct.	As far as I recall, yeah.
2 Q	When were you asked to become the special assistant for

3 Ukraine negotiations?
4	A	In May of this year.
5	Q	Who asked you?
6	A	Christopher Anderson.
7	Q	And what was his role at the time?
8	A	He was special adviser to Ambassador Volker.
9	Q	So he asked you to replace him?
10 A	That's correct.
11 Q	And -- just one second.
12 [Discussion off the record.]
13 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
14 Q	What did Mr. Anderson say to you?
15 A	He asked me if I wanted his job.
16 Q	And did you agree immediately?
17 A	No.
18 Q	What was your - - what was your process before you ultimately

19 agreed?
20 A	I said, no, in more or less that tone of voice.	And then
21 thought about it for a little while and said, maybe I will think about
22 it.	And so we spoke again a couple of times, I think, in the following
23 week or two.


24 Q

25 A

And when did you ultimately agree to take the job?
I don't remember the specifie date, but it	was roughly early

26
UNCLASSIFIED


1 to mid-May.

2 Q	And when did you officially come on board?
3 A	I think you could measure it by when I traveled to Kyiv, which

4 I believe was May 29th, but there I was embedded in the political section
5 for a month, and then officially started here in Washington on July
6	8.

7 Q	So you were in Kyiv from May 29th until when?
8 A	July 1, I believe.
9 Q	One thing I just want to go back to before I move ahead to

10 your time in Kyiv, the Javelins -- the provision of the Javelins in
11 20 -- late 2017, early 2018, do you recall whether there was ever a
12 hold or a freeze put on the Javelin provision?
13 A	There was a PCC process, and there was one hold -- sorry,
14 at the PC level, excuse me, the principals committee, and there was
15 one agency that put a hold on that decision.


16 Q

17 A

18 Q

19 A

20 Q

21 A

And which was that agency? 0MB.
Did you understand why?
I understood the reason to be a policy one. What was the policy one?
In a briefing with Mr. Mulvaney, the question centered around


22 the Russian reaction.


23 Q

24 A

What was the concern about the Russian reaction?
That Russia would react negatively to the provision of


25 Javelins to Ukraine.

27
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	What was the reaction to that concern from the other
2 agencies?
3 A	I don't know that I can provide that information in an
4 unclassified setting.
5 Q	Okay.	Is there any way to provide broadly?
6 A	I can broadly say that all of the policy agencies were in
7 support.


8 Q
9 A

10 Q

And you mean in support of providing the Javelins? Correct.
So how long was this hold placed?

11 A	I don't recall specifically, perhaps a week or two.
12 Q	And just to be clear, this policy went all the way up the
13 chain from sub PCC, to PCC, to DC, to principals committee.	Is that
14 correct?


15 A
16 Q

That's correct.
And at all of the prior levels, so to speak, was there

17 any -- was there any concern expressed about this policy change?
18 A	I think to go into specific details about what was discussed
19 at those meetings I would need to be in a classified setting.


20 Q
21 that
22 A

23 Q
24 A

I was just asking was there any concern expressed by anybody


All of the agencies were in agreement.
Okay.	Including 0MB up until the principals committee?
I don't recall 0MB expressing a policy objection at those


25 levels.

28
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Just so we understand, what role does 0MB have in making
2 foreign -- official foreign policy?
3 A	I think, typically, its role is usually limited to the budget
4 side of things.	So it was rather unusual to have 0MB expressing
5 concerns that were purely policy-based and not budget-oriented.
6 Q	And your experience, either on the Ukraine desk at the State
7 Department or at the National Security Council, were you aware of 0MB,
8 in any other circumstance, expressing policy reservations?
9 A	At the beginning of the Ukrainian Javelin process, I had been
10 told that 0MB was taking a policy interest.	And 0MB began sending
11 working level officials to attend meetings, even at the sub PCC level,
12 which was very unusual at the time.	And they weren't just attending
13 Ukraine-related meetings, they were coming to all of our meetings,
14 which, as an aside, is quite taxing on a very small organization.


15 Q

16 A

17 Q

Small organization being the National Security Council? No, on 0MB to staff that number of meetings.
Got it.	Got it.	So they -- 0MB took an interest in


18 countries other than Ukraine policy as well?
19 A	Yes.
20 Q	How - - you said that the hold was a week or two.	How - - what
21 was the process for the hold to be lifted?	What did you understand
22 the reasoning to be?
23 A	I was asked, along with my colleague, Richard Hooker to go
24 brief Mick Mulvaney on the decision.	We did so, and then within a day
25 or two, the hold was lifted.

29
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	And can you, without getting into classified material, can
2 you explain what your broad message was to Mr. Mulvaney?
3 A	Broadly, the message was that the policy process had worked,
4 that the potential issues on all fronts had been thoroughly discussed
5 and sussed out, and that had the agencies were in agreement about the
6 policy moving forward -- or about their recommendation to the
7 President.
8 Q	Did you address the concerns that he had expressed about
9 Russia's reaction to this policy change?


10 A

11 Q

12 A

13 Q

14 A

Yes.
What did you say?
I think that's the part that I can't refer to here. Who directed you to go brief Mr. Mulvaney?
I believe it	was a staffer at 0MB that said that Mr. Mulvaney


15 wanted to be briefed.
16 Q	And do you - - if the decision was made at the end of December
17 to provide the Javelins.	Did that decision go through the whole PCC
18 process?


19 A

20 Q

21 A

22 Q

I'm sorry, the Javelin decision? Yes.
Yes.	Sub PCC, PCC, DC, PC.
So at that point, the decision at the end of the December


23 had already been through this process?
24 A	That's correct.
25 Q	So what was the process that Mr. Mulvaney intervened in if

30
UNCLASSIFIED


1 it had already approved?
2 A	At the PC level, he objected.
3 Q	So he objected in December?	I'm asking if he objected to
4 the initial decision, or did he object to the release or provision of
5 the Javelins?
6 A	I see.	I understand the question now.	He objected in the
7 PC, it was a paper PC, but he objected in the PC.

8 Q	The original one about the decision ultimately in December?
9 A	Before the decision in December, in the tee-up to that

10 decision.
11 Q	So that had nothing to do with the timing of the actual
12 provision of the Javelins to Ukraine?
13 A	It held up the overall decision-making timeline.
14 Q	Understood.	Okay.
15 Now in -- did Rob Blair have a role in this process with Mr.

16Mulvaney?17AI understood him to be playing some sort of policy role in18briefingMr. Mulvaney.19QWhat was that role that you understood?20AI don't know specifically.21QDid you ever have any conversation with Mr. Blair about this?22AI did not, no.23QDo you know whether the President weighed in, in any respect,24on this decision?25AThe decision was made by the President.



31
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	I understand.	But do you know whether the President - - let
2 me ask you it a different way.	Do you know whether the
3 President - - whether Mr. Mulvaney was relaying the President's concerns
4 when he put the hold on for fear of the impact on Russia?
5 A	I don't know if the President and Mr. Mulvaney spoke on this.

6 Q	Okay.
7 A	I don't have any independent knowledge.
8 Q	In your meeting with Mr. Mulvaney, did he reference the

9 President's views at all?
10 A	Not that I recall, but the President's views were pretty
11 well-known.

12 Q	And what were they?
13 A	The President was skeptical of providing weapons to Ukraine.
14 Q	Why?
15 A	When this was discussed, including in front of the Ukrainian

16 delegation, in front of President Poroshenko, he described his concerns
17 being that Ukraine was corrupt, that it was capable of being a very
18 rich country, and that the United States shouldn't pay for it, but
19 instead, we should be providing aid through loans.
20 Q	Okay.	And so how did that relate to the provision of
21 Javelins?
22 A	I'm sorry.	What do you mean?
23 Q	You said the President's views on Ukraine were very
24 well-known.	And I'm trying to understand how the views that you just
25 expressed, might impact the ultimate decision to provide Javelins to

32
UNCLASSIFIED


1 the Ukraine?
2 A	So those views were expressed directly to President
3 Poroshenko in response to his desire for Javelins.
4 Q	Ah, okay.	And were the Javelins, at that time, that were
5 being provided, a -- what -- a gift, or were they being sold to Ukraine?
6 A	They were being provided using grant assistance through
7 foreign military financing.
8 Q	So just so we understand, ultimately it was U.S. financial
9 support to Ukraine that Ukraine used to purchase the Javelins?


10 A

11 Q

Yes.
So you indicated the President's views that Ukraine should


12 pay for their own -- pay their own way, effectively, in reaction to
13 President Poroshenko's request for lethal military assistance?	Is
14 that an accurate summary?


15 A

16 Q

That's how I understood the President's comments, yes. After that meeting with President Poroshenko, did you have

17 any occasion to learn the President's views more specifically
18 on -- during the policy process to provide the Javelins?
19 A	Inasmuch as I was tasked, and retasked, and retasked, and
20 retasked by General McMaster to write paper to help him make the case
21 to the President, I started to get a sense of what the President's
22 concerns were.


23 Q
24 A

And what were those concerns?
That Ukraine is corrupt, and that Europe should be stepping


25 up to do more to provide security assistance to Ukraine.

33
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Did you have an understanding at that time as to how much
2 security assistance Europe was providing to Ukraine?

3 A	Yes.
4 Q	And I mean, taking all the European - - EU countries together,

5 how did it compare to how much security assistance the United States
6 was providing?
7 A	The	our European partners in general their security
8 assistance is significantly less than U.S. security assistance.	We
9 are, by far, the lead.


10 Q

11 A

12 Q

That's on an individual country basis, or all told? Even all told.
Because there's been reporting that all told -- does that


13 change over time, I guess, is the question since 2017 to the present?
14 A	So our Ukrainian partners do provide security assistance,
15 and they do partner with us in training the Ukraine armed forces, and
16 they do provide separately some equipment and other financial
17 assistance.	But the quantities are significantly less than what the
18 United States provides.	One of the cases that we were attempting to
19 make at the time was that even though we lead on security assistance,
20 our European partners lead on providing overall economic assistance,
21 which, I think, it's fairly easy to make the case that in these Ukrainian
22 circumstances in 2015, 16, 17, economic security and national security
23 were closely tied.
24 Q	Okay.	So just so we're clear, the European countries led
25 on what you were calling economic assistance, and the United States

34
UNCLASSIFIED


1 led on what you're calling security assistance?
2 A	I think that's correct, yes.

3 Q	And how -- can you explain the difference between the two?
4 A	So World Bank, IMF, EBRO, EU generally, then bilaterally,

5 several of our European partners -- also credit to Japan -- were
6 providing economic -- loan guarantees and other forms of sort of
7 economic aid to help stabilize the country, immediately following
8 Russia's invasion in 2015.
9 Q	Would you say both are important to Ukraine's viability as
10 a democracy?
11 A	Absolutely.	I think without that, that assistance, Ukraine
12 wouldn't be in the relatively stable position that it is in now.
13 Q	And would you say that the security assistance	how should
14 I say this -- is more specifically appropriated than economic
15 assistance?	In other words, does security assistance, is it tied more
16 directly to particular aspects of support than the economic assistance
17 would be?
18 A	Yes.	I think bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress has
19 meant tremendous support, specifically on security assistance, and
20 that has meant some specific conditionality, including on defense
21 reform and provision of defensive weapons, and/or counter artillery
22 radar is part of the overall legislative package.
23 Q	As part of that legislative package, in order to provide the
24 security assistance, there are a number of conditions that Ukraine must
25 meet.	Is that right?

35
UNCLASSIFIED



1AThat's right.2QAnd you -- I think you described a couple of them, but could3you justlist the ones that you're aware of?4AI think the key one is with regard to the Ukraine Security
5 Assistance Initiative or USAI, which is the DOD pot of money, which
6 is specifically tied to DOD making a certification that Ukraine has
7 made adequate progress in defense reform.	And then, sort of,
8 implementation of that legislation, the State Department and DOD have
9 worked together to, sort of, set standards for what it is we expect
10 Ukraine to do to reform its defense sector.


11 Q
12 A

13 Q

And does that also include anticorruption efforts? Yes.
But economic assistance that Europe is the lead on, does it

14 have the same -- are you aware of whether Europe insists on some of
15 the same conditionality?
16 A	The conditionality for economic assistance tends to be set
17 sort of which IMF in the lead and then with other economic or
18 international financial institutions an countries like the United
19 States sort of falling behind on the IMF's lead on what conditionality
20 would look like.
21 Q	Okay.	So just to close the loop on this, Mr. Mulvaney's
22 concerns about the impact on Russia, do you know whether the -- did
23 you hear after your meeting with Mr. Mulvaney, whether he had a
24 conversation with the President about this issue before the decision
25 was made?

36
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	I'm sorry, before the Javelin decision in 2017?
2 Q	Yes.
3 A	No, I'm not aware of any conversations directly between the
4 two of them that I recall being told about.
5 Q	And it was General McMaster's strong view that the U.S.
6 should provide the Javelins to Ukraine.	Is that correct?


7 A

8 Q

9 A

10 Q

Yes, also General Mattis at the time.
General Mattis.	What about Secretary of State Tillerson? He also agreed.
So all the principals of the interagency agreed.	Is that


11 correct?


12 A

13 Q

Yes.
And to your knowledge, it was a pretty -- other than OMB's


14 unusual intervention, it was broadly supported by the policymakers?
15 A	Yes -- sprry, I need to revise.	Yes, everybody agreed
16 except for 0MB.
17 Q	All right.	And could you just explain why - - I'm sorry, Mr.
18 Chairman.
19 THE CHAIRMAN:	Before counsel goes on to a different subject, I
20 want to ask a few follow-up questions.	You mentioned that -- at one
21 point that you had taken notes contemporaneously with events.	Is that
22 a pattern of yours, or a practice of yours?
23 MS. CROFT:	I try to.
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	And did you receive a request from the State
25 Department for all of notes and documents and records related to the

37
UNCLASSIFIED


1 investigation?

2 MS. CROFT:	Yes.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	So the notes that you would have taken relevant

4 to Ukraine during the course of your time working on this, would those
5 have been provided to the State Department?

6 MS. CROFT:	Yes, those have all been provided.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	My colleague asked you about concerns that were

8 raised by Mulvaney.	If I understand correctly, Mr. Mulvaney didn't
9 raise these concerns in person, they were raised on paper.	Is that
10 right?
11 MS. CROFT:	Yes, in an objection on -- in -- during the course
12 of a paper PC.
13 THE CHAIRMAN:	So during the course of the paper PC, Mr. Mulvaney
14 objected in writing to the provision of the Javelins at that point?

15 MS. CROFT:	Yes.
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	And are you able to tell us in an unclassified

17 forum the nature of his objection?
18 MS. CROFT:	I can say that it	was a policy based objection.	And
19 then as I said before, when we spoke to him, Robert Hooker and I, he
20 asked about the Russian reaction.
21 THE CHAIRMAN:	When you say he asked - - he asked in person or he
22 asked in writing?
23 MS. CROFT:	He blocked - - he blocked the decision at the PC level
24 in writing, and then subsequently we briefed him in person, and that
25 was the conversation where he -- where he asked questions about the

38
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Russian reaction.
2 THE CHAIRMAN:	And  as	best   you   can    remember,  when  did	the	0MB
3 first  putits  hold  on  the    provision  of  the  Javelins?	And when was the

4 decision made to	release the hold?
5 MS. CROFT:	I don't recall the very specifie dates without access

6 to	my files from that time, which I don't have access to.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	That   would   be   documented  in   the	records you

8 provided to the State Department?
9 MS. CROFT:	No.	Those would be records from my time at the

10 National Security Council, which would be - - which are in the National

11 Archives.
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Well, given that we don't have those with
13 us  today,   let's askforthebest  of your  recollection.	About when was
14 the   hold  put in  place?	About how long elapsed before the decision was

15 made to	release the Javelin?
16 MS. CROFT:	My best guess, without access to my notes, is I

17 believe that that would have probably been in November or early
18 December,  when,  I  think,  back to when the	President made his decision.
19 In the time that it took to facilitate thePresident's decision, I don't
20 recall  specifically when  the	paper PC went out, what those dates were.

21 THE CHAIRMAN:	So you' re talking about November, December, 2017?
22 MS. CROFT:	That's correct.

23 THE CHAIRMAN:	And can you give us sort of your best estimate of
24 the	range of how long the hold would have been put in place, how many

25 weeks?

39
UNCLASSIFIED


1 MS. CROFT:	My recollection is about 2 weeks, but like I said,
2 without my notes, it's hard to refresh my memory.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	And what was going on with respect to Ukraine
4 during those 2 weeks, in terms of what you were following in press
5 accounts?	Do you remember?
6 MS. CROFT:	I don't.	I was very focused on the Javelin decision.
7 I don't have a specific memory of what was happening _ in the press at
8 the time.
9 THE CHAIRMAN:	During the period, either before the hold, during
10 the hold, or after the hold, were you aware of any discussions going
11 on about Ukraine's participation or nonparticipation in assisting the
12 Mueller investigation?
13 MS. CROFT:	Nothing that I was doing in my work at the National
14 Security Council in any way related to what was happening in the Mueller
15 investigation.
16 THE CHAIRMAN:	No, I understand that.	But we're obviously
17 looking at allegations concerning the hold-up of military assistance
18 in 2019.	We're looking at a call record in which the President of
19 Ukraine asks - - says he's almost ready to get more Javelins.	And we
20 know during this period there is a hold put on military assistance.
21 And as I'm sure you're aware from public accounts, there are questions
22 about why that hold was placed, and testimony that was related to
23 political demands by the President.
24 So what I'm asking you is, did it come to your attention in any
25 way, shape, or form, through conversation, open reporting or otherwise,

40
UNCLASSIFIED


1 that there may have been factors behind the first hold on the Javelins,
2 the 2017 hold on the Javelins, that were not related to policy, that
3	may have been related to investigations that the President wanted the
4 Ukraine to do, or work that the President wanted Ukraine to refrain
5 from doing in connection with the Mueller investigation?
6 MS. CROFT:	I was not aware of any connection between those two
7 things, and don't recall having any conversations with anybody about
8 the Mueller investigation at that time.	I would say that OMB's
9 decision to hold on the Javelin decision at the PC level, given OMB's
10 signaled interest in engaging in a policy basis came as a surprise,
11 but had -- was proceeded by 0MB engagement on the issue.
12 And in fact, I had, throughout from the beginning of my time at
13 the NSC, engaged 0MB regularly to inform them about we were doing on
14 the Javelins in order to try to over -- overcome any policy concerns
15 that I could through the work of the interagency.	So, in my mind,
16 because I hadn't heard any connection between what was happening in
17 terms of the Mueller investigation and security assistance, I had not
18 made that connection, and nobody had made that connection to me.
19 THE CHAIRMAN:	I'm jumping forward a bit here, but in 2019, you
20 were not a part of the conversations about specific investigations,
21 the President had sought in connection with White House meeting or
22 military assistance, that you were largely not in the loop on that?
23 MS. CROFT:	I was largely not in the loop on that.
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	Jumping back to 2017 again, the policy rationale
25 that you have articulated in terms of not wanting to anger the Russians




41
UNCLASSIFIED


1 by providing Javelins to Ukraine, there was a strong policy consensus
2 to do it, 0MB objected to it.	Did any of the 0MB objections that were
3 raised with you differ from the concern about angering or upsetting
4 the Russians?

5 MS. CROFT:	Not that I recall.
6 THE CHAIRMAN:	Mr. Goldman.
7 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
8 Q	Moving back to 2019, I just want to --
9 [Discussion off the record.]

42
UNCLASSIFIED


1	[10:15 a.m.]
2 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
3 Q	You said that you initially told Mr. Anderson no and you had
4 reservations.	What were your reservations?
5 A	I'd already done a lot of work on Ukraine.	I was looking
6 forward to my assignment in Baghdad, and I think the nature of
7 corruption in Ukraine always made it a tricky country to work on.
8 Q	By May, and you were -- were you aware of -- withdrawn.
9 You have already testified about you were following the press
10 accounts related to the false allegations against Ambassador
11 Yovanovitch, right?
12 A	Yes.
13 Q	Were you also aware of other narratives in the media related
14 to some of these other investigations that are the subject of this
15 inquiry?
16 A	I was following the John Solomon reporting in The Hill with
17 concern and interest.
18 Q	And what do you recall about the John Solomon reporting,
19 separate and apart from anything in connection with Ambassador
20 Yovanovitch?
21 A	He appeared to be building a case based on sourcing through
22 then-Prosecutor General Lutsenko, and a former employee of the
23 Ukrainian Embassy in the United States, at the time, I think, very
24 focused on those two, that there was some connection between Ukraine
25 and interference in the 2016 elections, and the then-Ukrainian

43
UNCLASSIFIED


1 administration having a preference for the outcome of the 2016
2 election.
3 Q	And were you aware of any factual basis to support those
4 allegations, based on your time focused on Ukraine around 2016?
5 A	I was aware that Paul Manafort was associated with the
6 Yanukovych regime, which, of course, had been ousted and then-President
7 Poroshenko would have been a rival of Yanukovych.	So I anticipated
8 that that might be sort of an angle of inquiry.
9 Q	I don't understand.	What does that have to do with the
10 allegations of -- Yanukovych was removed in 2014, right?
11 A	Right.
12 Q	Okay.	So the -- what are the -- can you explain a little
13 more to me?
14 A	It's a little bit weird.	So Poroshenko and Yanukovych were,
15 of course, rivals.	Poroshenko saw that Trump's campaign manager was
16 affiliated with Yanukovych, and so I could imagine at the time that
17 Poroshenko would have concerns about potential policy shifts on Ukraine
18 following the 2016 election.
19 I was also aware that the Republican platform had changed with
20 regard to provision of security assistance in the lead-up to that
21 election.	So I imagined that Poroshenko was paying attention to that
22 fact as well.
23 Q	Okay.	So you understand why there might be a motivation,
24 but you were not aware of any factual basis for those allegations?
25 A	Correct, absolutely.

44
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	And were you aware by May that Rudy Giuliani was also
2 promoting some of these narratives?
3 A	Yes.	I started to see some of the same narratives pop up.
4 Q	And then were you aware at that time about a narrative related
5 to Burisma Holdings and Vice President Biden?
6 A	I was aware of Hunter Biden's role in the Ukrainian energy
7 sector from my time on the Ukraine desk.
8 Q	And were you aware that that was -- that whole subject was
9 one of the things that Mr. Giuliani was promoting in the media?


10 A

11 Q

I became aware when he started tweeting about it.
And do you recall that there was a fairly -- there was an


12 article May 9th in The New York Times that got a fair amount of
13 attention, where Mr. Giuliani said that he was going to go to Ukraine
14 to pressure the Ukrainian Government for investigations?


15 A

16 Q

Yes.	I --
Was this during the time that you were considering whether


17 or not to take this job?
18 A	Yeah.	I don't actually remember the day that Chris and I
19 had that conversation, but it was probably around that time.
20 Q	And how, if at all, did these narratives that were being
21 played out in the media, through Mr. Giuliani and others, affect your
22 thinking on whether you were going to take this job?


23 A

24 Q

25 A

They made me certainly a lot more trepidatious. Why?
I knew from my experience on the Ukraine desk and from working

- - - -- - - - - - - - - --- -



45
UNCLASSIFIED


1 at the NSC that, like I said before, the nature of the corruption in
2 Ukraine makes it a particularly difficult country to work on, because
3 it is difficult to know at any given time what interests are behind
4 what actions.
5 But one of the reasons that I ultimately agreed to take the job
6 was because I felt I was probably better positioned than most to help
7 and advise the Department to manage those tricky waters, and because
8 I didn't want anyone else to get exposed to what I'm doing today.

9QWhat do you mean by that?	You took one for the team?10AYes.11QWhat were you concerned about others having to deal with?12AThat I was watching those narratives play out in the media,13 and I thought at the time that it was possible that the Trump
14 administration would choose to change its policy to suit domestic
15 politics.
16 Q	Did you have any conversations with Ambassador Volker before
17 you took the job?
18 A	Actually, no.	I'd already -- I'd worked with him before.
19 We knew each other from before.


20 Q

21 A

Do you recall when you first spoke with him? In this capacity or in general?

22 Q	Sorry.	Yes, in this capacity, after you -- I guess after
23 you accepted the job, when was the first time that you spoke with
24 Ambassador Volker?
25 A	It would have been when I got back from Kyiv the week of the

46
UNCLASSIFIED


1 8th, but I'm not certain specifically.	Oh, it was when we had a meeting
2 with	So
3 whatever date that was.	I don't have the specific date with me.

4 Q	Was that in D.C.?
5 A	That was here in D.C., yes.
6 Q	So you didn 't speak with Ambassador Volker from May until

7 you returned to D.C. after July 1st, even though you were going to be
8 working directly for him?


9 A

10 Q

No, I spoke with Chris.	He was in touch with Kurt.
Did you speak with Mr. Anderson about these narratives that


11 were playing out in the media related to Mr. Giuliani?
12 A	Not until I got back.
13 Q	When you -- during the time that you were in Kyiv -- well,
14 when you arrived in Kyiv, who was leading the Embassy?
15 A	The now DCM, Kristina Kvien, had just arrived around the same
16 time that I did, I think.


17 Q

18 A

19 Q

20 A

21 Q

22 A

23 Q

So Ambassador Yovanovitch was gone? She was gone.
The former DCM was gone? That's right.
And Ambassador Taylor had not yet arrived? Correct.
When Ambassador -- during your time in Kyiv in June, did you


24 have any conversations with Ambassador Taylor about the narratives that
25 were playing out in the media?

47
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	I had a conversation with Ambassador Taylor before he went
2 to Ukraine as he was considering taking the position.

3 Q	And can you describe for us that conversation?
4 A	As he's -- as I understand from media reports that he has

5 testified before, he had come to the Department with concerns that the
6 U.S. policy on Ukraine might change and wanted to get the Department's
7 views on that.
8 I sat down with him and shared my very frank assessment that the
9 White House was not likely to change its policy on Ukraine except in
10 the event that the President viewed it -- the -- that Biden was going
11 to be a credible rival for him in the upcoming election, and that
12 he - - that furthering the narrative that Russia was for the Republicans
13 and Ukraine was for the Democrats would be in his interest, and that
14 might push him to change the policy on Ukraine.	But I said that,
15 otherwise, I saw no reason that our policy would change.
16 Q	And were you aware at that -- well, when was that meeting
17 with Ambassador Taylor, do you recall?
18 A	That would have been in May, very shortly before I headed
19 out to Kyiv.
20 Q	So just before May 29th?


21 A

22 Q

Yeah.
And were you aware by that point that Vice President Biden


23 had announced his candidacy for President?
24 A	I don't remember when he announced his candidacy for
25 President.

48
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	But you knew that he was -
2 A	Of course, yes.
3 Q	a potential candidate?
4 A	Yes.
5 Q	So I just want to understand this.	When you say the White

6 House policy towards Ukraine, do you mean official U.S. policy
7 supporting Ukraine in a bipartisan basis?

8ANo, I mean the President's views.
9QYou mean the President's views?10AYes.11QAnd so what -- when you said the President's views were not12 going to change, what were the President's views that you understood
13 at that time?
14 A	What I've articulated so far, that he was skeptical of
15 Ukraine as a corrupt country, but he had reversed the decision on
16 Javelins.	So I didn't take him to be sort of anti-Ukraine, aside from,
17 obviously, this very strongly held view that it is a corrupt country.
18 But I knew that the rest of the interagency remained united in its
19 support for Ukraine.
20 Q	And so, can you explain how the Biden candidacy would
21 potentially -- how you thought the Biden candidacy would potentially
22 impact the President's views on Ukraine, as you explained it to
23 Ambassador Taylor?
24 A	Yeah.	This was just sort of my speculation, as somebody who
25 has watched Ukraine for a while and as somebody who had worked in the

49
UNCLASSIFIED


1 White House, but that my understanding was that, you know, in an attempt
2 to -- that it seemed logical to me that in an attempt to counter the
3 narrative about Russian support for the Trump administration in the
4 2016 election or Russian interference in the 2016 election that - - that
5 it would be useful to shift that narrative by shifting it to Ukraine
6 as being in support of the Clintons.
7 Q	And how would that affect the President's policy views
8 towards Ukraine?
9 A	The way I thought about it was that painting sort of Ukraine
10 as being against Trump would help distract from a narrative or balance
11 out a narrative that he had gotten help in the 2016 election from Russia.
12 Does that answer your question?
13 Q	Understood.	I guess the question is, if he already had
14 negative views of Ukraine, how would the effect of Vice President
15 Biden's candidacy change his views, which I think you said that's the
16 only way
17 MR. RATCLIFFE :	Just to be clear, are you asking the witness to
18 speculate as to the President's frame of mind?
19 MR. GOLDMAN:	No.	I'm asking the witness, based on her
20 experience for several years related to Ukraine, how she interpreted
21 the narratives that were in the media at the time related to
22 investigations.
23 MR. RATCLIFFE:	You used the words "the President's thinking."
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	Excuse me.	Excuse me.	She's describing a
25 conversation she had with Ambassador Taylor.	I'll permit the

so
UNCLASSIFIED


1 question.	You may answer.
2 MR. RATCLIFFE :	Let the record reflect the chairman -- I'll
3 withdraw that.
4 THE CHAIRMAN:	You can answer the question.
s	MS. CROFT:	Sorry, can you repeat the question?
6 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
7 Q	You testified that you indicated to Ambassador Taylor that
8 the only way that the White House policy would change was somehow
9 related to this Biden narrative.


10 A

11 Q

Yes, thank you.
And I'm just asking how the Biden narrative would change what


12 you've described as the President's negative views towards Ukraine?
13 A	That, I think, in order to sort of credibly paint Ukraine
14 as the enemy in both the 2016 elections and potentially moving forward
15 to 2020 elections, that that would not be consistent with supporting
16 Ukraine, in terms of providing lethal assistance or other forms of
17 political support.	Is that responsive?
18 Q	It is responsive, but it goes back to, I think, the earlier
19 question I said, which is that the policy change would be from the
20 overall support for Ukraine to less support for Ukraine.	Is that true?
21 The policy change that would flow from that would be to reverse the
22 support for Ukraine.
23 A	That is correct.	That was as Ambassador Taylor sort of
24 articulated his concern to me, and that was the question that I was
25 responding to when I gave that answer.

51
UNCLASSIFIED



1QAnd how did Ambassador Taylor articulate the concern to you?2ATo the best of my recollection, he said, I want to do this
3 job, but only - - or I'm willing to do this job, only as long our policy
4 on Ukraine remains the same, meaning support for Ukraine.	But if that
5 changes, or if that's going to change, then I would quit.

6 Q	Did he bring up Rudy Giuliani or the Biden narrative to you?
7 A	I raised the Biden narrative with him.	I don't recall

8 whether we discussed Giuliani or not.
9 Q	Do you know whether he had already met with Secretary Pompeo
10 by the time that you had this conversation?
11 A	I believe he was due to meet with Pompeo after that
12 conversation.
13 Q	And did he tell you what he expected to speak to Secretary
14 Pompeo about?
15 A	My understanding is he was going to ask Secretary Pompeo the
16 same question.
17 Q	And in that meeting with Ambassador Taylor, did he discuss
18 with you at all a May 23rd meeting at the White House with President
19 Trump related to Ukraine?
20 A	I believe that we did discuss it with regard to how he saw
21 his role on Ukraine policy vis-a-vis Ambassador Volker specifically,
22 given the role I was taking on.
23 THE CHAIRMAN:	We're going to come back to that next round.	I
24 just have a couple questions before our time expires.
25 Going back to the Javelins, it was the consensus of U.S.

52
UNCLASSIFIED


1 policymakers within the NSC and State Department that the Javelins
2 should be provided.	The lone objector was 0MB.	Is that right?
3 MS. CROFT:	The lone objector in the paper PC on the Javelin
4 decision was 0MB.
5 THE CHAIRMAN:	So it was the view of -- apart from 0MB, it was
6 the unanimous view that providing Javelins to Ukraine would help
7 Ukraine in its defense against Russia and would, therefore, be in U.S.
8 national security interest?

9 MS. CROFT:	Correct.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	If we didn't provide Javelins to Ukraine, would

11 that serve Russia's interest?
12 MS. CROFT:	In my opinion, yes.
13 THE CHAIRMAN:	Our time has expired.	One hour to the minority.
14 MS. CROFT:	Sorry.	I don't want to interrupt you once we start
15 on your hour.	I wonder if I could use a break?

16 THE CHAIRMAN:	Of course.	Let's take a 5-minute break.
17 [Recess.]
18 THE CHAIRMAN:	All right.	Let's come to order.

19 One hour with the minority.
20 BY MR. CASTOR:
21 Q	Ms. Croft, I'm Steve Castor with the Republican staff.
22 Thanks for being here today.	I know this is not the most comfortable
23 environment, so thank you for your willingness to sit through this and
24 be helpful with your questions.
25 I'm an investigative person.	I work on investigations of all

53
UNCLASSIFIED


1 types, not necessarily those relating to the State Department, so if
2 I get any of these pronunciations wrong or if I don't have a sufficient
3 understanding of how things really work at the State Department, I
4 hope - - I mean no disrespect, and I hope you'11 just help me understand.
5 Before becoming Ambassador Volker's -- before joining his team,
6 you were in Arabic language training.	Is that right?
7 A	That's right.


8 Q

9 A

10 Q

And you were aiming to head to Baghdad? That is correct.
Okay.	And how did you break that -- that assignment, you


11 know, in terms of going over to help Ambassador Volker?
12 A	So for certain high-danger posts, the Department will allow
13 you to break assignment without any explanation, and that was the case
14 here.
15 Q	Okay.	And was it your initiative to break that or
16 did -- other than Mr. Anderson, I know you mentioned him.
17 A	Yes, I broke the assignment to take this position.	But
18 interestingly, just a few days later, I got the notice that my position
19 was removed in the drawdown.

20QOkay.	And you had worked with Ambassador Volker before?21AYes.22QAnd you had a good working relationship with him?23AYes.24QHow long have you known the Ambassador?25AI believe I would have met him in or around July of 2017,
54
UNCLASSIFIED


1	when he became the special rep.

2QOkay.	That was the first time you met him?3AI believe so, yeah.4QOkay.	He's a person of high integrity?5AYes.6QA person that in all aspects of his work would do things that
7 he believed were in the best interest of the United States?

8 A	Yes.	In my opinion, yes.
9 Q	You were on detail to the National Security Council, if I

10 have this correct, between July 2017 and July 2018?
11 A	That's right.
12 Q	How do those postings work or detailees when you're a State
13 Department official?	How do you get selected or how do you bid for
14 those opportunities?
15 A	In my case, I was approached by my predecessor, who asked
16 me to take on the role.	And I was, of course, also hesitant.	But then,
17 I agreed to sit down with Fiona Hill and Richard Hooker for an interview.


18 Q

19 A

20 Q

21 A

22 Q

Who was the predecessor?

And you interviewed with Fiona Hill? Yes, and Richard Hooker.
And how does the process work inside of the State Department,


23 in terms of getting permission to be a detailee?
24 A	I think poorly.	I can't illuminate, but it's a lot more than
25 that.

55
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	What are the mechanics of it?
2 A	As I understood it, there was a formal request from the
3 executive secretary at the NSC to the executive secretary at the State
4 Department, and then it is a black box until I'm told to report for
5 duty.
6 Q	Okay.	And how long was that?	Like, how long were you in
7 limbo before you reported to the NSC?
8 A	Longer than would be normal.	I don't remember specifically
9 how long, but because at the time, Tillerson had put a block on all
10 NSC -- or on all State detailees to the NSC.
11 Q	Okay.	And was the block ultimately lifted?	Is that what
12 allowed you to go over there?
13 A	I believe it was lifted, if I recall correctly, on sort of
14 a case-by-case basis.	So specifically, my detail was authorized.
15 Q	Okay.	And did you know anybody when you went over to the
16 NSC, or just those you interviewed with?

17 A	I knew several members of the previous team.
18 Q	Okay.
19 A	In Pound (ph), Russia.
20 Q	And did you know Dr. Hill?
21 A	Only when I interviewed for the job.
22 Q	Okay, that was the first time you met her?
23 A	Yes.
24 Q	And how did the reporting relationship work?	You reported

25 to Dr. Hill, and then she reported to -- who did she report to?

56
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	I reported to Dr. Hill, and then she reported to the National
2 Security Advisor, sometimes through the Deputy National Security
3 Advisor.

4 Q	At the time, it was General McMaster?
5 A	I worked under both General McMaster and under Ambassador

6 Bolton.
7 Q	If my dates are right, General McMaster was there until April
8	of 2018?


9 A

10 Q

That sounds right.	I don't remember the specific date. Okay.	Were things different under General McMaster and

11 Ambassador Bolton, in terms of how the NSC worked?
12 A	Oh, yeah.
13 Q	And can you describe those differences?
14 A	General McMaster had very strong views about process and how
15 process should work, and had worked hard to establish a process and
16 create a series of strategies and implementation plans.	And, you know,
17 it was sort of - - it	was sort of like being at war college, though I've
18 never been at war college, but that's how I imagine it felt; whereas,
19 under Ambassador Bolton, there were -- that process slowed down
20 significantly.
21 Q	Okay.	And you were at the NSC for a year?
22 A	That's right.


23 Q

24 A

And what were the circumstances of you leaving NSC?
When I took the position at the NSC, because we, as Foreign


25 Service Officers, bid a year out, I had already -- or at some point

57
UNCLASSIFIED


1 very early on in my tenure, I had agreed to go to Baghdad following
2 the assignment.

3 Q	Okay.	So it was a 1-year posting?
4 A	It	was a 1-year posting.	The NSC did actually ask me to stay

5 on for a second year, and I agreed to do it.	But then with the
6 transition from McMaster to Bolton, I decided not to.


7 Q

8 A

9 Q

10 A

Okay.
Not because of Bolton.
Okay.	Why did you decide not to?
I specifically had wanted to work for General McMaster, but,


11 also, because I had sort of decided that that transition was going to
12 create a lot of chaos and work, and that I needed some downtime.

13 Q	And how was your working relationship with Dr. Hill?
14 A	Excellent.
15 Q	And did she include you in all the matters related to Ukraine
16 and your portfolio?
17 A	Yes.	As far as I'm aware, yeah.
18 Q	And what was your portfolio?
19 A	Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, the Caucasus and OSCE.
20 Q	And who took your job when you left the NSC?
21 A	My job was divided up into different portfolios.	So nobody
22 took my full portfolio.
23 Q	Did you transition out of your job when you left the NSC and

24 went back to State Department with the incoming person?
25 A	On the Caucasus side, no, that position was left vacant for





58
UNCLASSIFIED


1 a period of time.	On the Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus side, I had a brief
2 overlap with Alex Vindman.
3 Q	Okay.	And did you have -- how long was the overlap?

4 A	I think it was a week.
5 Q	Okay.	And was that a good transition period?	Was that

6 enough time to get Lieutenant Colonel Vindman up to speed on the issues?

7 A	It's more than NSC directors usually get.
8 Q	Okay.	And then when you were back at the State Department

9 working for Ambassador Volker, how did that situation work?	He was
10 an unpaid official, correct?
11 A	That's right.
12 Q	Okay.	And so, your organization, was it, you and him or did
13 you have additional staff support?
14 A	We had an office management specialist, like a secretary.
15 Q	But you were his only direct report?


16 A

17 Q

Yes.
And I'm going to go through some of the events that have been


18 part of the committee's inquiry, just to see if you have any firsthand
19 information on them.	Were you part of the trip, did you participate
20 at all in the inaugural which was in May of 2019?	I think that is
21 slightly before your posting began.
22 A	That is correct, that was before my posting began.
23 Q	Okay.	Did your predecessor participate in that trip?


24 A

25 Q

I believe so, yeah.
So Mr. Anderson, he traveled to Ukraine?

59
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	That's my recollection, but I think he'd have to answer that.
2 Q	Okay.	And during the -- so you said that in the month of
3 June, you traveled to Kyiv and worked out of the embassy there?
4 A	That's right.

5 Q	Was that for the full month?
6 A	Yeah.	I got in - - I flew out May 29th or 28th, or something

7 like that, and I left, I believe, July 1.
8 Q	Okay.	And during your time in Kyiv, was Ambassador Volker,
9 was he traveling to Kyiv at the same time?


10 A

11 trip.

Ambassador Volker was not in Kyiv while I was there on that

12 Q	Okay.	And what was the purpose of your going to Kyiv for

13 that one-month period?


14 A

So while I had worked on Ukraine issues quite a bit in D.C.,


15 I had never actually served at our Embassy in Kyiv.	So this was for
16 me -- we'd had a lot of turnover at the Embassy, so partly for me to
17 get to know the new team out in Kyiv and, in part, just to have some
18 time on the ground.
19 Q	Okay.	And that was effective for you?

20 A	Yeah.
21 Q	The - - Ambassador Volker had pretty good relationships with

22 the Ukrainian officials.	Is that fair to say?


23 A

24 Q

Yes, I think that's fair to say.
Which Ukrainian officials did he have relationships with


25 that he kept in regular contact?

60
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	I understood him to be in very regular contact with Andrey
2 Yermak, as well as the now-foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko.	I
3 believe he met with President Zelensky four, five, six times, something
4 like that.

5 Q	Were you in any of those meetings?
6 A	I was not in any of those meetings.
7 Q	Were you with Ambassador Volker during the July -- did you

8 travel to Kyiv with Ambassador Volker on the July 25th-26th trip?

9AYes, I was with him.10QBut you weren't in the meeting with President Zelensky?11ANo.12QDo you remember who was in the meeting with Ambassador Volker13and thePresident July 26?14AOn the U.S. side?15QYeah.16AIt was Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sandland, Ambassador17 Taylor, a representative from the political section as note-taker, and
18 I believe an interpreter from the U.S. Embassy was present as well.
19 Q	And did you get a readout of that meeting?
20 A	I got a very brief readout from Ambassador Taylor on the car
21 ride away from the meeting.


22 Q
23 A

And what do you remember from that readout?
I remember that his recount -- so he recounted to me what


24 Zelensky said in that meeting about the phone call with the President,
25 and that overall it was a very upbeat readout, and the part that I was

61
UNCLASSIFIED


1 focused on getting out of that readout was about the possibility of
2 scheduling a face-to-face meeting between the President and President
3 Zelensky.
4 And so we discussed the potential for an encounter at Warsaw,
5 because they were both going to be there at the same time.	We
6 discussed -- but we discussed the need separately for an invite to an
7 Oval.	And I recall Ambassador Taylor being fairly optimistic about
8 our ability to get that meeting scheduled.
9 Q	Okay.	There's been some discussion of whether during that
10 meeting, President Trump's demands were, you know, discussed or whether
11 the, you know, Ukrainians needed help navigating what those demands
12 might have been.	Did you hear anything of that sort?
13 A	I believe I recall hearing Ambassador Taylor mentioning that
14 the President raised investigations there, but I don't have a very
15 specific memory of anything that was said with that regard.
16 Q	So the Ambassador told you that President Zelensky related
17 to him it was an upbeat meeting, but there was a mention of
18 investigations?
19 A	No.	I believe that Ambassador Taylor said that the
20 President did raise investigations in that meeting, but my memory of
21 that part of the readout isn't as strong as the part about trying to
22 get an Oval meeting.
23 Q	Okay.	Did you have an understanding of what the
24 investigations were at that point?
25 A	I understood it to be investigations into interference in

62
UNCLASSIFIED


1 the 2016 election.
2 Q	Okay.	But not related to the company called Burisma?
3 A	I do not specifically recall whether Burisma came up or not
4 in the readout that I got.
5 Q	Is Burisma a company you're familiar with in your experience
6 as a Ukrainian -- an expert with Ukraine?
7 A	No, not especially.	I didn't deal a whole lot with energy
8 issues, except at a very sort of high-policy level.
9 Q	You were on the Ukraine desk for a period of time, I think
10 you mentioned?

11 A	Yes, 2 years.
12 Q	What was that time period?
13 A	August 2015 to July 2017.
14 Q	And during your time on the Ukraine desk, did you ever come

15 across any information about Burisma?
16 A	I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of an energy
17 company.


18 Q

19 A

20 Q

Okay.	Which was Burisma? Yes.
Okay.	But you hadn't heard anything about - - I guess there


21 was an oligarch named Zlochevsky who was a former ecology minister that
22 ran Burisma.	Did you know that?


23 A

24 Q

25 A

Yeah, I don't know anything about Zlochevsky. Okay.	So you only knew about the Hunter Biden? I only knew about that, yeah.

63
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	And what can you tell us about that?
2 A	Nothing more than what I've already said, that at the time,

3 I was aware that the Vice President's son was serving on the board of
4 an energy company.	But my portfolio didn't deal in -- on the energy
5 or the economic side at that time.	I was very focused on the defense
6 issues, and so --

7 Q	Okay.	So that was just something you learned in passing?
8 A	Yes, exactly.
9 Q	Okay.	And were there any other - - how did you learn it?	It

10 was in cable traffic, or did a colleague mention it to you?
11 A	I think it just came up, yeah, in conversation somebody was
12 sort of annoyed that that was the case, but I can't remember
13 specifically who said it, or under what circumstance.
14 Q	And do you remember what they may have been annoyed about?
15 A	You know, I think just sort of a general concern about the
16 appearance of the Vice President's son doing business in Ukraine.
17 Q	At the time, Vice President Biden, did he have an interest
18 in Ukraine?
19 A	Yes.	I mean in a policy sense.
20 Q	Oh, sure.	What can you tell us about that?
21 A	At the time, the Vice President was very engaged on Ukraine
22 policy.	He spoke several times with President Poroshenko, and spoke
23 to -- if I recall correctly, spoke to other world leaders in support
24 of Ukraine as well.
25 Q	You mentioned earlier in the first hour some of the different

64
UNCLASSIFIED


1 forms of assistance the United States provides to Ukraine.	There's
2 the FMF and the USAI.	Are those the two primary vehicles to provide
3 security assistance and economic assistance to Ukraine?
4 A	Since -- yes, since 2015, those are the two primary vehicles.
5 Q	And one is operated by DOD, the other is the State Department?

6 A	That is correct.
7 Q	And did you have any role in your dealings at the State

8 Department on the FMF component of this?
9 A	Yes.	My portfolio included both FMF and also the sort of
10 our full picture of security assistance.
11 Q	Okay.	And did the loan guarantee process also factor into
12 the FMF pot of money?
13 A	No.	Those were separate.
14 Q	Okay.	And how were those -- how were the loan guarantees
15 to Ukraine handled?
16 A	I don't know the mechanics of how our loan guarantees worked.
17 Like I said, that was sort of handled by the economic side of the Ukraine
18 desk at the time, so I wasn't responsible for that.
19 Q	Okay.	But it was handled by State Department officials?
20 A	There was a policy role in it,	but exactly, like I said, how
21 the mechanics work about these loan guarantees I don't know.
22 Q	Do you know how the loan guarantees figured into the
23 interagency process?
24 A	I'm not exactly sure how to answer that question, but I think
25 I know what you're getting at, so I'm going to try to go there.	And

65
UNCLASSIFIED


1 that is that, in general, our loan guarantees, like all other forms
2 of economic assistance, were conditioned on Ukraine meeting certain
3 reform benchmarks.	And, as I testified before, those reform
4 benchmarks are usually sort of set with the IMF in the lead.
5 Is that responsive to you?

6 Q	Yes, it	is?
7 A	Your question?	Okay.
8 Q	If there was going to be a decision to withdraw a loan

9 guarantee, would that go through the PCC process?
10 A	I believe, yeah, that all of the questions about the loan
11 guarantees went through the interagency process.	But, like I said
12 before, I wasn't participating in it contemporaneously.
13 Q	Okay.	Are you familiar, was there an interagency decision
14 in 2016 or before to provide Javelins to the Ukraine?
15 A	No.


16 Q

17 A

That was a new initiative in 2017?
Let me be more -- try to be more specific with the question.


18 The interagency considered the question of whether to provide Ukraine
19 Javelins, but no positive decision was made until 2017.
20 Q	Okay.	And can you tell us what you remember about that
21 process?
22 A	My recollection is that there was a series of interagency
23 meetings on whether we should lift the ban against providing Ukraine
24 defensive weapons, and specifically, how we should respond to Ukraine's
25 request for Javelin antitank missile systems.

66
UNCLASSIFIED



1Myunder -- I recall that going up to, I believe, at least, the2PC levelunder the previous administration, I don't recall if that3decisionwas blocked at the NSA or at the Presidential level, but --4QNSC or NSA?5ANSA, NSA.6QOkay.	I thought you said NSA.7AOkay.8QOkay?9AYeah.10QYou're not sure where it was blocked?11AI know that the agencies broadly supported the provision of12Javelinsunder the previous administration as well, but that the White
13 House did not authorize it.


14 Q

15 A

And do you know what was the basis for that nonauthorization? My understanding at the time that it was at least, in part,

16 over concerns about how Russia would respond, and whether it would be
17 provocative.
18 Q	But the interagency, what was united before it got to the
19 White House?


20 A

21 Q

22 A

The policy - - the policy agencies were united in their view. And that changed in 2017?
No, the policy agencies have always been consistent on their


23 views on the provision of Javelins.
24 Q	Okay.	So what changed between 2016 or earlier, and then the
25 new administration?

67
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	The President made a different decision than the previous
2 President had.
3 Q	And do you remember when that occurred?	I think you may have

t just so I'm tracking it properly.



6 Q	Okay.	So if I understood what you were testifying to this
7 morning, there was -- it was approved, but then there was a hold on
8 it?

9 A	No.	So the specifie process was there was a sub PCC, a PCC,
10 a DC, and a paper PC.	When that paper PC went out, all of the agencies
11 came back with their reactions.	The only objector was 0MB at the PC
12 level.	Does that make sense?
13 Q	Yes, it	does.
14 A	Okay.	And that was - - so that was to get all principals on
15 the same page about what to recommend to the President.	So that
16 preceded the President's decision.
17 Q	Okay.	And then 0MB ultimately lifted their concern?
18 A	Correct.	They lifted their block, yeah.


19 Q

20 A

They lifted their block, and that was when?
It -- like I said before, I believe it would have been in


21 like November or early December, but I don't recall the specifie dates.
22 And I am not allowed to keep my notes from that period of time, so I
23 have no way of refreshing my memory.


24 Q

25 A

Okay, fair enough.	Do you remember roughly how long it was? Like I said before, I believe it was -- you mean how long

68
UNCLASSIFIED


1 the 0MB block was?

2 Q	How long the hold was, yes.
3 A	Yeah, I believe it was roughly a couple weeks, but, again,

4 I can't say for sure without refreshing my memory with my notes, and
5 I don't have access to those.
6 Q	Okay.	Was there anything unusual you remember about that
7 time period, or was it just part of the ordinary bureaucratic speed
8 bumps that often occur?
9 A	No.	0MB's decision to object, and to do so on a policy basis
10 was highly unusual.
11 Q	Okay.	But, ultimately, 0MB lifted their hold and the money
12 was released, or the authorization for the money was released?
13 A	Ultimately, 0MB lifted their objection at the PC level, and
14 the decision went to the President.
15 Q	There was discussion this morning in the first hour that the
16 delay of the Javelins served Russia's interest?
17 A	Are you referring -- sorry -- a decision to not provide
18 Javelins


19 Q

20 A

Yes.
-- would serve Russia's interest.


21 Q	Yes, right.	So I'm just trying to understand the difference
22 between the Obama and the new administration on that position.	I mean,
23 if during the Obama era, there was a reluctance to provide the Javelins,
24 did that, too, serve Russia's interest?
25 A	I believe so.

69
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Was that part of the evaluation of changing the position?
2 A	Can I ask you to reframe that question?
3 Q	Was providing lethal defensive assistance to the Ukraine,

4 was part of the reason that was advocated for was it	would help prevent
5 Russian aggression?


6 A

7 Q

8 A

9 Q

10 A

Sorry, that providing
Providing the Ukraine the money for the Javelins - Yeah.
-- helped Ukraine defend themselves, right?
I'm sorry, there was a couple double negatives in there.	I


11 just want to make sure that I answer it accurately.


12 Q

13 A

So the Javelins help Ukraine defend themselves, right? The Javelins help Ukraine defend themselves.	A decision to

14 provide Javelins we believe is a counter to Russia's interests.	Is
15 that

4 Q	Okay.	Once you returned to the United States, I guess that
5 was the beginning of July, do you remember any significant events
6 relating to -- you know, involving Ambassador Volker's involvement
7 with the Rudy Giuliani piece of this?
8 A	I don't know what you mean by like significant events, but
9 that is, as I've testified to, the first time that I learned that
10 Ambassador Volker was in touch.


11 Q

12 A

And when was that?
That would have been the week of July 8.	I don't remember


13 the specific date.
14 Q	Did you have any discussions with Ambassador Volker about
15 the challenges presented by the Giuliani involvement?
16 A	We had one discussion in which I thanked him for keeping me
17 out of that mess, and then, you know, I think another, you know, a couple
18 times he mentioned sort of a need to get this Giuliani line of effort,
19 sort of, off the table, so we can get on with the business of our actual
20 policy.	Those weren't his exact words, but that would have been the
21 spirit of --


22 Q

23 A

Did he ever articulate to you his strategy with that?
Not very specifically.	Like I said, I had thanked him for


24 keeping me out of that mess.
25 Q	Did he communicate to you that he believed Mr. Giuliani was

71
UNCLASSIFIED


1 amplifying a negative narrative and fueling the President's mistrust
2 of Ukraine?
3 A	Yes.	You know, my interpretation of his intention was that
4 he hoped that he could convince Giuliani and the President that the
s	new -- the new administration in Ukraine was different from the old
6 one, that they were serious about combating corruption, and that they
7 merited us dealing with in a serious fashion and that it was in our
8 interest to deal with the new administration and support their efforts
9 to combat corruption.
10 Q	Did Volker ever walk you through some of the investigations
11 that were discussed at this time, or what the requests were?


12 A
13 Q

No, he never walked me through any of those conversations. Did you ever hear Ambassador Volker talk about, you know,

14 investigating the Bidens as something that, you know, some parts of
15 the U.S. Government were interested in?
16 A	I had one brief exchange, I think, with Ambassador Taylor
17 and Ambassador Volker, but I don't remember the exact date .	I remember
18 that we were in Kyiv at the time.	But concerned about the difference
19 between a request for, broadly speaking, investigation into
20 interference in the 2016 election, and then specifically, into specifie
21 cases of corruption, and our sort of shared discomfort at the line
22 between those two things.
23 Q	Okay.	Were they interconnected or were they two separate
24 buckets?
25 A	I don't know the answer to that question.	Like I said in

72
UNCLASSIFIED


1 my opening statement, my work was sort of outside of that line of effort,
2 and I sort of was not briefed on Ambassador Volker's conversations with
3 Giuliani.
4 Q	Okay.	Did you know whether Ambassador Volker was advocating
s	for investigations related to the Bidens?
6 A	I don't know what he may or may not have said to Giuliani,
7 or -- and, like I said, I wasn't present in his conversations one-on-one
8 with Zelensky, so I don't know the answer to that question.


9 Q

10 A

Did he ever relate to you what his views on that were?
I think he shared our collective discomfort with the idea


11 that we would be requesting specific investigations on a specific
12 individual, but, like I said, we didn't talk a lot about that.	Most
13 of my conversations with him were centered around trying to get an Oval
14 meeting set up and trying to advance our negotiations.	So I had a lot
15 of other things to talk to him about other than this.
16 Q	Okay.	Did he ever tell you that he told Giuliani that
17 there's no basis to investigate the Vice President, the former Vice
18 President?
19 A	Like I said, he never talked to me about what his
20 conversations with Giuliani were about.

1	[11:26 a.m.]
2 BY MR. CASTOR:
3 Q	Okay.	How frequently did you interact with Ambassador
4 Volker?

5 A	Almost daily, I would say.
6 Q	Okay.	Was it mostly by email or is it telephone as well?
7 A	Email and WhatsApp.	Mostly WhatsApp.
8 Q	Okay.	Just texting on WhatsApp?

9 A	Yeah.	Or in person if we were traveling together or
10 something like that.
11 Q	Okay.	During your time with Ambassador Volker, did you ever
12 hear him mention the word the Bidens in connection with an
13 investigation?
14 A	Oh, gosh.	I don't have any specific memory of that, no.
15 Q	So in any of the meetings that you attended with him you don't
16 recall the Bidens coming up -- with Ukrainians?
17 A	I would have to go back through my notes to try to recall
18 if any of that ever came up.
19 Q	Okay.	But as you sit here today you don't --
20 A	There's nothing that stands out in my memory right this
21 minute, no.


22 Q

23 A

24 Q

Okay.	How about with the company Burisma? Same answer.
Okay.	So your recollection of the discussion of


25 investigations, to the extent it got specific, it related mostly to









78
UNCLASSIFIED


1 But, you know, I think he was sort of objectively outside of his lane.
2 So that's sort of a difficult question to answer.
3 Q	Did he ever represent to you in your presence that he was
4 in contact with the President?

5 A	Yes.
6 Q	Okay.	And what can you tell us about that?
7 A	Only that he would make passing reference to:	I'm going to

8 call the President after this or I've spoken with the President or
9 something like that.	But this was always, like I said, at least in
10 my presence about the idea of getting this Oval meeting set up.
11 Q	Okay.	So did it seem like he was in constant contact with
12 the President?


13 A

14 Q

I wouldn't know.	I just heard passing references.
Okay.	Do you think Ambassador Volker, to the best of your


15 knowledge, you know, appreciated Ambassador Sandland's ability to have
16 communications with the President or was it a little bit of an issue?
17 A	I never personally witnessed any, you know, conflict between
18 those two, but I don't know what they spoke about when I wasn't present.
19 Q	Okay.	You mentioned that your first week on the job you had
20 a discussion with Ambassador Volker about keeping you out of the Rudy
21 Giuliani?
22 A	I don't remember if that was that week or if it was on a
23 different occasion.


24 Q

4 Q	But it was before the August 28th time period, do you think?
5 A	I believe it was, yes.

6 Q	Okay.	And these are	and what did you -- what do you

7 remember telling these folks?
8 A	I remember telling them that I was confident that any issues
I	in process would get resolved.	And I knew
10	  that they had no
11 interest in this information getting out into the public.
12 Q	Okay.	And did they call you together or was it	two separate

13 calls?
I	A	Two separate.

2 THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	Let's go back on the record.	I just have

3 a few questions before I turn it back to counsel.
4 I won't ask you to go into the changed circumstances on the ground
5 in Ukraine between the Obama administration and the Trump
6 administration.
7 The invasion of Ukraine took place while Barack Obama was
8 President?
9 MS. CROFT:	That's correct.
10 THE CHAIRMAN:	And that was a very hot war initially?
11 MS. CROFT:	Absolutely.
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	And so over time the risk of escalation may have
13 changed?
14 MS. CROFT:	Absolutely.
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	But I was struck by something you said during the
16 Trump administration, and that was that it was very unusual for 0MB
17 to weigh in on a policy decision like the provision of Javelins to
18 Ukraine.	Why was that so unusual?
19 MS. CROFT:	I had never heard of 0MB injecting itself into a
20 purely policy discussion or decisionmaking process.	What struck me
21 about it especially is, first, that that position was in contrast to
22 all of the traditional foreign policy-making agencies long held and
23 long expressed views.	And, secondly, that the objection or concerns
24 expressed were not related to the money, the budget part of 0MB, but
25 rather to the policy part of the decision.
