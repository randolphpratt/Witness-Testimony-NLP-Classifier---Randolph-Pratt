THE CHAIRMAN:	Okay.	The committee will come to order.
2 Good morning, Ambassador, and welcome to the House Permanent
3 Select Committee on Intelligence, which along with the
4 Forei gn Affairs and Oversight, Committees, is conducting this
5 investigation as part of the official impeachment inquiry of
6 the House of Representatives.
7 Today's deposition is being conducted as part of the
8 i nquiry .	On behalf of all of us today, on both sides of the
9 table, I want to thank you for your decades of service to the
10 Nation, and especially for so ably representing the United
11 States as our Ambassador to Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine.
12 As you know firsthand, the post-Soviet space has presented a
13 myriad of challenges for success of American administrations.
14 And as the successor states, the former USSR continue to
15 grapple with the consequences of 70 years of Communism.
16 I've read about the curtailment of your posting i n Kyiv,
17 and I have seen the shameful attacks made on you by those who
18 lack your character and devotion to country.	While we will
19 doubtless explore more fully the circumstances of your
20 premature recall during this interview, I'm appalled that any
21 administration would treat a dedicated public servant as you
22 have been treated.
23 As you know, the White House and the Secretary of State
24 have spared no effort in trying to prevent you and others
25 from meeting with us to tell us the facts.	Because of the

5



administration's efforts to block your deposition and
2 obstruct your inquiry, the committee had no choice but to
3 compel your appearance today.	We thank you for complying
4 with the duly authorized congressional subpoena.
5 Finally, I want you to know that the Congress will not
6 tolerate any attempt to retaliate against you or to exact
7 retribution of any kind.	We expect that you' ll be treated in
8 accordance with your rank, and offered assignments
9 commensurate with your expertise and long service.	Should
10 that not be the case, we will hold those responsible to
I I	account.
12 2	Before I turn to committee counsel to begin the
13 deposition, I invite Ranking Member N un es or any member of
1 4	HPSCI, or in their absence, any of my minority colleagues to
15 make opening r ema r ks on Mr. Nunes' behalf.
16 MR. J ORDAN:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.	Just for the
17 7	record, on October 2nd, 2019, the Speaker of the House, Nancy
18 Pelosi, said that she would treat the President with
19 fairness.	Fa ir ness requires certain things.	Just a few
20 minutes ago, the chairman of the Intel Committee said that
21 this is an official impeachment inquiry.
22 If it's an official impeachment inquiry, we should be
23 following precedent.	Every recent impeachment has permitted
24 minority subpoenas.	The right of the minority to issue
25 subpoenas subject to the same rules as the majority has been

6




the standard bipartisan practice in all recent resolutions
2 author i zi ng presidential impeachment inquiries.	That is not
3 the case today, has not been the case sin ce th i s, quote,
4 "official impeachment i nqu i ry" began.
5 Democ rat s' failure to provide ranking members with equal
6 subpoena power shows this is a partisan investigation.
7 Second, Democrats have threatened witnesses who request
8 agency counsel to be present for their tran scr i bed interview
9 and/or dep ositi on.	State Department lawyers have a right to
IO	protect executive branch interests, i nclud i ng national
II security interests.	Democrats have threatened to withhold
12 salaries of State Department officials who ask for the
13 presence of State Department lawyers in depositions.
14 I've been in countless number of depositions and/ or
15 transcribed i nterv i ews, this is only the second one I've ever
16 seen where agency counsel was not perm i tted to be in the room
17 when a witness was deposed or asked questions, the first was
18 last Thursday.	The first witness as a part of this, qu ote ,
19 "off i c i al impeachment i nqu i ry."
20 And, finally, fa i rn ess r equi res due process.	The
21 President and minority should have the right to see all
22 evidence, both favorable and unfavorable.	The President and
23 mi nor i ty should have the ability to p resen t evi de nce bearing
24 on the cred i bi lit y of testifying witnesses.	The President
25 and the m i nor i ty should have the ab i l i ty to raise objections

7



relating to examination of witnesses, and the admissibility
2 of testimony and evidence.	And the Pre si dent and the
3 minority should have the ability to respond to all evidence
4 and testimony presented.
5 With that, I would like to yield to my co ll eague from
6 the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Zeldin, for a f ew items to
7 put on the record as well.
8 MR. ZELDIN:	Yesterday, Ranking Member Mccaul sent a
9 letter to Chairman Engel consistent with what Mr. Jordan was
10 just referencing on the record, calling on the chair to honor
I I	the bipartisan Rodino Hyde precedence that governed both the
12 Nixon and Clinton impeachment inquires, which guaranteed the
13 President's counsel the right to participate in these
14 proceedings, and allowed the minority to exercise coequal
15 subpoena author i ty.
16 Moving on.	The question is, what specific provision of
17 House rules gives the House Permanent Select Committee on
18 Intelligence the jurisdiction and authority to convene an
19 investigative inquiry of a State Department diplomat
20 regarding the conduct of U.S. fo r ei gn policy toward Ukraine?
21 That is clearly the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affa i rs
22 Committee, and to date, the House has not voted to give the
23 I n te l Committee any additional authority to conduct an
24 impeachment inquiry outside of its jur i sdi ct i onal la ne, which
25 concerns intelligence-related activities.



8




Can you please point us to anything in the House rules
2 that gives you this authority?
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	We're going to move forward with the
4 deposition rather than address the mischaracterizations of
5 both impeachment history and inquiries and process.	I would
6 now recognize Mr. Goldman .
7 MR. MEADOWS:	Mr. Chairman, point of order.	Point of
8 order.
9 THE CHAIRMA N:	My colleague, we're not going to allow -­
10 MR. MEADOWS:	Well, you can't not allow -- I'm here to
11 tell you, Mr. Schiff --
12 THE CHAIRMAN:	We're not going to allow any dilatory
13 MR. MEADOWS:	you know the House rules allows for
14 po· nt of order in any
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	State your point of order.
16 MR. MEADOWS:	The point of order is the rules of the
17 House are very clear.	The gentleman raised a valid point
18 that there are no rules that would give the authority of you

19 to actually depose this witness.	And so. under what
20 authority -- I would say you're out of order.
21 THE CHAIRMAN:	I appreciate your opinion, but the House
22 deposition r ule s say otherwise.	So, Mr. Goldman, you are
23 recognized.
24 MR . z ELDIN:	Poi nt of order , though , we a re aski ng what
25 that rule is that gives you the authority to conduct today 's

9



deposition.
2 MR. MEADOWS:	Rule 11 doesn' t outline anything.
3 THE CHAIRMAN:	We won' t allow any further dilatory
4 mot i on,s.	M r. Gold man, you' re recogni zed.
5 MR. ZELDIN:	We're asking a simple que sti on.
6 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thi s i s the deposition of Ambassador Marie
7 Yovanovitch conducted by the House Permanent Select Committee
&	on Intellige nce , also called HPSCI, pursuant to the
9	impeachment inquiry announced by the Speaker of t he House on
10	September 24th.
II MR. GOLDMAN:	Ambassador Yova nov i tch , cou ld you please
12 state you r full name and spell your last name for the record.
13 MR . ROBBINS:	I'm sorry , before we begin the deposition.
14 Sor ry , I represent the witness.	My name is Larr y Robb i ns.
15 The ambassador has an opening state ment to make.
16 MR. GOLDMAN:	We'r e going to get to that.
17 MR. ROBBINS:	I see.
18 MR . GOLDMAN:	Aft er we lay out the ground rul es here,
19 we'll turn it over to the Ambassador.
20 MR. ROBBINS:	Okay.	It's a deal.
21 MR . GOLDMAN:	All right.	If you could go ahead and
22 please state your ful l nam e and spell it for the record.
23 MS. YOVANOVITCH:	Mar i e Louise Yovanovitch.	Marie,
24 M-A-R-I-E, Louise, L-0-U-I-S-E, Yovanov i tch ,
25	Y-0-V-A-N-O-V-I-T-C-H.

10




MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you.	Along with other proceedings
2 in furtherance of the inquiry, the deposition is part of a
3 joint investigation led by the Permanent Select Committee on
4 Intelligence in coordination with the Committee on Foreign
5 Affairs. and the Committee on Oversight and Reform.
6 In the room today. I believe, are at least given the
7 option of having two majority staff and two minority staff
8 from both the Foreign Affairs and the Oversight Committees,
9 as well as majority and minority staff from HPSCI.	This is a
10 staff-led deposition, but members, of course, may ask
II	questions during the allotted time.
12 My name is Daniel Goldman, I'm a senior advisor and
13 director of investigations for the HPSCI majority staff, and
14 I'd li ke to thank you for coming in today for this
15 deposition.	I'd like to do some brief introductions.	To my
16 right is Nicolas Mitchell, senior investigative counsel for
17 HPSCI.	Mr. Mitchell and I will be conducting most of the
18 interview for the majority.
19 And I will now let my counterparts who will be ask i ng
20 any questions introduce themselves.
21 MR. CASTOR:	Good morning, Ambassador.	My name is Steve
22 Castor, I'm a staffer with the Oversight and Government
23 Reform Committee, minority staff.
24 MR. BREWER:	Good morning.	I'm David Brewer from
25 Oversight as well.

11




MR. GOLDMAN:	This deposition will be conducted entirely
2 at the unclassified leve l.	However, the deposition is being
3 conducted in HPSCI's secure space s, and i n the presence of
4 staff who all have appropriate security clearances.	It is
5 the committee's expectation that neither questions asked of
6 the witness nor answers by the witness or the witness'
7 counsel will require discussion of any information that is
8 currently, or at any point could be properly classified under
9 executive order 13526.
10 Moreover, E0-13526 states that, quote, "in no case shall
I I	i nf ormat i on be classified, continue to be maintained as
12 classified, or fail to be declassified," unquote, for the
13 purpose of concea l i ng any violations of law or preventing
14 embarrassment of any person or entity.	If any of our
15 questions can only be answered with classified information,
16 Ambass ado r Yovanovitch, we'd ask you to inform us of that and
17 we will adjust acco rd i ngly .
18 I would also just note for the record that my
19 understanding is that Ambassador Yovanovitch's counsel also
20 has the necessary security clearances .	Is t hat r i gh t?
21 1	MR. ROBBINS:	That is correct.
22 MR. GOLDMAN:	All right.	Today's dep osi ti on is not
23 being taken in executive session, but because of the
24 sensitive and confidential nature of some of the topics and
25 materials that will be discussed, access to the transcript of



12




the deposition will be limited to three committees in
2 attendance.	You and your attorney will have an opportunity
3 to review the transcript as well.	Per the House rules for
4 this deposition, no members or staff may discuss the contents
5 of this deposition outside of the three committees, including
6 in public.
7 Before we begin, I'd like to briefly go over the ground
8 rules for this deposition.	We'll be following the House
9 regulations for depositions.	We have previously provided
10 your counsel with a copy of those regulations, and we have
II copies here if you would like to review them at any time.
12 The deposition will proceed as follows:
13 The majority will be given 1 hour to ask questions and
14 then the minority will be given 1 hour to ask questions.
15 Ther eafter , we will alternate back and forth between majority
16 and minority in 45-minute rounds until questioning is
17 complete.	We will take periodic breaks, but if you need a
18 break at any time, please let us know.
19 Under the House deposition rules, counsel for other
20 persons or government agencies may not attend.	And we can
21 point you to the deposition rule if anyone would like to look
22 at it.	You are allowed to have an attorney present during
23 this deposition, and I see that you have brought th r ee.	And
24 at th i s time, if counsel could state their names for the
25 record.

13



MR. ROBBINS:	So I'm Lawrence Robbins from the firm of
2 Robbins Russell, representing the Ambassador.	With me are
3 Laurie Rubenstein and Rachel Li Wai Suen, also from our firm,
4 also for the witness.
5 MR. GOLDMAN:	There is a stenographer. or two. taking
6 down everythihg that is said here in order to make a written
7 record of the deposition.	For the record to be clear, please
8 wait until the questions are finished before you begin your
9 answer, and we will wait until you finish your response
10 before asking the next question.	The stenographer cannot
II	record nonverbal answers. such as shaking your head.	So i t
12 is important that you answer each question with an audible
13 verbal answer.
14 We ask that you give complete replies to questions based
15 on your best recollection.	If the question is unclear or you
16 are uncertain in your response, please l et us know.	And if
17 you do not know the answer to a question or cannot remember,
18 simply say so.
19 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a
20 privilege that is recognized by the committee.	If you refuse
21 to answer a question on the bas i s of privilege, staff may
22 either proceed with the depos i ti on or seek a ruling fr om
23 Chairman Schiff on the objection during the deposition at a
24 time of the majority staff's choosing.	If the chair
25 overrules any such objection during the deposition, you are

14




required to answer the question.	These are the House
2 deposition rules.
3 Finally, you are reminded that it is unlawful to
4 deliberately prov i de f al se information to Members of Cong r ess
5 or staff.	It is i mperative	that you not only answer our
6 questions truthfully, but that you give full and complete
7 answers to all questions asked of you.	Omissions may also be
8 considered false statements .
9 Now, as this deposition is under oath, Ambassador
10 Yovanov i tch , would you please raise your rig h t hand and stand
II	and you ' ll be sworn in.	Do you swear or af fir m that the
12	testimony you are about to give is the whole truth and 1 3	nothing but the truth?
14	MS. YOVANOVITCH:	I do.
1 5	MR . GOLDMAN :	Thank you.	The record will refl ect that
16 the witness has been duly sworn, and you may be sea ted.	Now,
17 Ambassador Yovanovitch, I understa nd you have some openi ng
18 r emar ks and now is the time to do them.
19 MS. YOVANOVITCH:	Thank you.	Cha ir man Schiff,
20 Mr. J ordan , and other members and staff who are here today .
21 I really do thank you for the opportunity to start with a
22 statement.	And I'd like to introduce myself.	For the
23 last -- for the last 33 years, it's been my great honor to
24 serve the American people as a Foreign Service Offi ce r over
25 six adm i n i stra ti ons. four Republican and two Democrat .	I

15



have served in seven different count ri es; five of them have
2 been hardship posts, and I was appointed to serve as an
3 ambassador three times, twice by a Republican President, once
4 by a Democratic President.
5 Throughout my career, I have stayed true to the oath
6 that Foreign Service Officers take and observe every day,
7 that I  will support and defend th e Const i tut i on of the United
8 States against all enemies, foreign and domest i c, and that I
9 will bear tr ue faith and allegiance to the same.	Li ke all
10 Foreign Service Officers with whom I have been privileged to II	serve, I have understood that oath as a commitment to serve 1 2	on a strictly nonpartisan basis, to advance the foreign
13 3	policy determined by the i ncumben t Pre si dent , and to work at
14 all t i mes to strengthen our national secu r i ty and promote our
15 national i nterests .
16 I come by these beliefs honestly and thr ough personal
17 experience.	My parents fled Comm un i st and Nazi regimes.	And
18 having seen, firsthand, the war and poverty and displacement
19 common to totalitarian r egi mes , they valued the freedom and
20 de mocra cy the U.S. offers, and tha t the United States
21 r epresent s.	And they raised me to cher i sh those values as
22 well.
23 Their sacrifice allowed me to attend P r i ncet on
24 University, whe re I focused my studies on the former Soviet
25 Union.	And gi ve n my upbr i ng i ng and my background, it has

16




been the honor of a lifetime to help to foster those
2	principles as a career Foreign Service Officer.	From
3	August 2016 until May 2019. I served as the U.S. Ambassador
4 to Ukraine.	Our policy, fully embraced by Democrats and
5 Republicans alike. was to help Ukraine become a stable and
6 independent democratic state, with a market economy
7 int eg r ated into Europe.	Ukraine is a sovereign country whose
8 borders a re i n vi ol ate , and whose people have the rig h t to
9 determine their own d esti ny.	These ar e the bedrock
10 principles of our policy.
11 Because of Ukra i ne's geostrategic position bordering
1 2	Russia on its east, the warm waters of the oi l-r i ch Black Sea
13 to i ts south, and four NATO allies to its west, it i s
14 critical to the security of the United States that Ukraine
15 remain free and democrat i c, and that it continue to resi st
16 Russian expansi on i sm.
17 Russia's purported annexation of Crimea, i ts invasion of
18 Eastern Ukraine, and its de facto control ove r the Sea of
19 Azov , make clear Russ i a' s malign intentions towards Ukra i ne.
20 If we allow Ru ssi a's actions to stand, we will set a
21 pr ecedent that the United States wi l l regret for decades to
22 come.
23 So supporting Ukra i ne' s integration into Europe and
24 combat i ng Russia's efforts to destabilize Ukrain e have
25 anchored our policy since the Ukra i ni an people protested on

17




the Maidan i n 2014 and demanded to be a part of Europe and
2 live according to the rule of law.	That was U.S. pol i cy when
3 I became ambassador in August 2016, and it was reaffirmed as
4 that policy as the policy of the current administration in 5	early 2017.
6 The Revolution of Dignity and the Uk r a i ni an pe ople ' s
7 deman d to end corruption forced the new Ukrainian Government
8 to ta ke measures to fight the rampant corruption that long
9 permeated that country's political and econom i c systems.	We
10 have long understood that strong anti-corruption efforts must
II	form an essential part of our po licy	in Ukraine, and now
12 there was a window of opportunity to do just exactly that.
13 And so why is that i mp ortan t?	And why is it important
14 to us?	Put simply, anti-corruption efforts serve Ukra in e' s
15 i ntere sts, but they also serve ours as well.	Corrupt leaders
16 are inherently less trustworthy, while honest and accountable
17 Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukraine partnership more
18 reli able and more valuable to us .	A level play i ng f i eld in
19 this strategically located country, one with a Eu r opean
20 landmass exceeded only by Russia, and with one of the la r ges t
21 populations in Europe, creates an environment in which U.S.
22 business can make more easily trade, invest, and profit.
23 Corruption is a security issue as well because corrupt
24 officials are vulnerable to Moscow.	In short, it is in our
25 national security interest to help. Ukra in e t r ansf orm i nto a



18




country where the rule of law governs and corruption is held
2 in check.
3 But change takes time, and the aspiration to instill
4 rule of law of values has still not been fulfilled.	Since
5 2014, Ukraine has been at war, not just with Russia, but
6 within itself, as political and economic forces compete to
7 determine what kind of country Ukraine will become.	The same
8 old oligarch-dominated Ukraine where corruption is not just
9 prevalent, but frankly is the system.	Or the country that
10 Ukrainians ·demanded	in the Revolution of Dignity.	A country
11 where rule of law is the system, corruption is tamed, and
12 people are treated equally, and according to the law.
13 During the 2019 pres i dent i al elections in Ukraine, the
14 people answered that quest i on once again.	Angered by
15 insufficient progress in the fight against corruption,
16 Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly voted for a man who said that
17 ending corruption would be his number one priority.	The
18 transition, however. created fear among the political elite,
19 setting the stage for some of the issues I expect we will be
20 discussing today.
21 Understanding Ukraine's recent history, including the
22 significant tension between th ose who seek to transform the
23 country, and those who wish to continue profiting from the
24 old ways, i s, I believe, of ·criti cal importance to

25 understanding the events you asked me here today to de scribe.

19



Many of these events, and the false narratives that emerge
2 from them, resulted from an unfortunate alliance between
3 Ukrainians who continue to operate within a cor r upt system
4 and Americans who either did not understand that system, that
5 corrupt system. or who may have chosen, for their own
6 purposes. to ignore it.
7 It is seems obvious, but I think bears stating under the
8 circumstances, that when dealing with officials from any
9 country, or those claiming contacts -- or connections to
10 officialdom, one must understand their background, their
II	personal interest, and what they hope to get out of that
12 particular interaction before deciding how to evaluate their
13 description of events or acting on their information.
14 To be clear, Ukraine is full of people who want the very
15 th i ngs we have always said we want for the United States, a
16 government that acts in the interest of the people, a
17 government of the people, by the people, for the people.	The
18 overwhelming support for President Zelensky in April's
19 election proved that.	And it was one of our most important
20 tasks at the embassy in Kyiv to understand and act upon the
21 difference between those who sought to serve their people and
22 those who sought to serve only themselves.
23 With that background in mind, I would like to briefly
24 address some of the specific issues raised in the press that
25 I ant i ci pate you may ask me about today.	So just to repeat.

20




I arrived in Ukraine on August 22, 2016, and I left Ukra i ne
2 permanently on May 20, 2019. Several of the events with
3 which you may be concerned occurred before I was even in the
4 country before I was ambassador. Here are just a few:
5 The release of the so-called Black Ledger, and Mr .
6 Manafort's subsequent resignation from the Trump campaign.
7 The Embassy's April 2016 letter to the Prosecutor Ge neral ' s
8 Office about the investigation into the Anti-Corruption
9 Acti on Center or AntAC. And the departure from office of IO	former Prosecutor General Viktor Shakin, who I have never II		met. These events all occurred before I arrived.
12 There are several events that occurred after I was
13 recalled from Ukraine. These include President Trump's
14	July 25th call with President Zelensky; all of the many
15 discussions that have been in the press sur rounding that
16 phone call; and any d i scussi on surrounding the reported delay
17 of security assistance to Ukraine in summer 2019. So that
18 happened after I depa rt ed.

As for the events during my tenure in Ukraine.	I really want
2 to make clear and I want to categorically state that I have
3 never , myself or through others, d ir ect ly or i nd i rectly , ever
4 directed, suggested , or in any other way asked , for any
S	government or governme nt offic i al in Ukraine or elsewhere to
6 refrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption.
7 As Mr. Lutsenko, the form er Ukraine prosecutor general,
8 has recently acknowledged, the notion that I created or
9 disseminated or verbally told him a do-not-prosecute l i st is
10 completely false.	And that is a story that M r. Lutsenko
II	himself has since retracted.
12 Equally f i cti ti ous is the notion that I am d i sloyal to
13 Pr es i dent Trump.	I have heard the al legat i on i n the media
14 that I supposedly told our em ba ssy team to ignore the
15 President's orders since he was goi ng to be impeached.	That
16 allegation is false.	I have never sa i d suc h a th i ng to my
17 embassy colleagues or anyone else.
18 Next, the Obama administration did not ask me to help
19 the Cl i nt on campaign, or harm the Tr ump campa i gn , and if they
20 had, I would never have taken any such steps.	I have never
21 met Hunter Biden, nor have I had any direct or i ndi re ct
22 conversations wi th him.	Of course , I have met former Vice
23 P resi dent Biden several times over the course of our many
24 years in government, but neither he nor the previous
25 administration ever directly or indirectly raised the issue

22




either of Burisma or Hunter Biden with me.
2 With respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have only had minimal
3 contact with him, a total of three that I	recall.	None
4 related to the events at issue.	I do not know Mr. Giuliani 's
5 motives for attacking me.	But individuals who have been
6 named in the press who have contact with Mr. G i ul i an i may
7 well have believed that their personal and financial
8 ambi ti ons were stymied by	our anti-corruption poli cy in
9 Ukraine.
10 F i na lly , after being asked by the Department in early
11	March to extend my tour, to stay on an extra year until 2020,
12 in late April, I was then abruptly asked to come back to
13 Washington from Ukraine on the next plane.	You will
14 understandably	want to ask why my posting ended so suddenly .
15 I   wanted to	learn that, too, and I tr i ed to find out.
16 I met wi th the Deputy Sec r etary of State, who informed
17 me of the curtailment of my term.	He said that the President
18 had lost confidence in me, and no longer wished me to ser ve
19 as an ambassador.	He added that there had been a concerted
20 campaign against me, and that the Department had been under
21 pressure from the President to remove me since the summer of
22 2018.	He also sa i d that I had done nothing wrong, and that

23this was not like othersituations where he had recalled24ambassadors for cause.I departed Ukraine for good this past25May.
23



Although I understand, everyone understands, that I
2 served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless
3 incredulous that the U.S. Government chose to remove an
4 ambassador based, as far as I can tell. on unfounde d and
5 false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.	To
6 make matte r s worse, all of this occurred during an especially
7 challenging time in bilateral relat i ons with a newly elected
8 Ukrainian President.	This was precisely the time when
 9 continuity at the U.S . Embassy in Ukra i ne was most needed. 1 0		Before I close, I must share with you the deep
II	disappointment and dismay I have felt as these events have
12 unfolded.	I have served this Nation honorably for more than
13 30 years.	I have proudly promoted and served American
14 interests as the representative of the American people and
15 six different Presidents over the last three decades.
16 Throughout that time, I, like my colleagues at the State
17 Depa rtm ent, have always believed that we have enjoyed a
18 sacred trust with our government.
19 We make a difference every day.	And I know many of you
20 have been out to embassies around the world, and you know
21 that to be true.	Whether it's a matter of war and peace,
22 trade and investment, or simply helping an American citizen
23 with a lost passport.	We repeatedly uproot our lives, and we
24 frequently put ourselves in ha r m' s way to serve our Nation,
25 and we do that willingly, because we believe in America and

24




its special role in the world.
2 We also believe that in return, our government will have
3 our backs and protect us if we come under attack from foreign
4 i nt erests .
5 That basic understanding no longer holds true.	Today,
6 we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from
7 within.	State Department leadership with Congress needs to
8 take action now to defend this great institution, and its
9 thousands of loyal and effective employees.	We need to
10 rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance Amer i ca ' s
II	interest, and the front line of America's defense.	I fear
12 that not doi ng so will harm our Nati on' s interest, perhaps
13 irreparably.	That harm will come not just through the
14 inevitable and continuing resi gnat i on and loss of many of
15 this Nati on' s most loyal and talented public ser vant s.	It
16 also will come when those d i plomat s who soldier on and do
17 their bes t to rep r esent our Nati on, face partners abroad who
18 question whether the ambassador really speaks for the
19 President, and can be counted upon as a reliable partner.
20 The harm will come when private interests circumvent
21 pr ofessi onal diplomats for the i r own ga i n , not for the public
22 good.	The harm will come when bad actors and countries
23 beyond Ukraine see how easy it i s to use f i ct i on and innuendo
24 to manipulate our system.	In such circumstances, the only
25 interests that are going to be served are those of our

25



strategic adversaries like Russia, that spread chaos and
2 attack the institutions and norms that the U.S. helped create
3 and which we have benefited from for the last 75 years.
4 I am proud of my work in Ukraine.	The U.S. Embassy
5 under my leadership represented and advanced the policies of
6 the United States Government as articulated first by the
7 Obama administration, and then by the Trump administration.
8 Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in
9 thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine who fought back by
10 selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would II		listen.	Sadly, someone was listening, and our Nation is
12 worse off for that.
13 So I want to thank you for your attention, and I welcome
14 your questions.	Thank you.
15 THE CHAIRMAN:	Thank you very much for your testimony.
16 Mr. Goldman .
17 MR. ROBBINS:	Excuse me, just before we begin.	Pardon
18 me, I have a terrible cold this morning and I apologize if
19 I'm hard to hear.	Mr. Chairman, I' d just like to put the
20 following on the record before we begin today's depos i t i on.
21 As you know, the Department of State, in which the
22 ambassador is still employed, has asserted that its lawyers
23 should be allowed to attend this deposition so that they can
24 assert privileges or objections the Department might wish to
25 assert on behalf of the executive branch.	As we have told

26




both State Department lawyers and committee lawyers, it is
2 not our place to get in the middle of that or to take sides
3 in a dispute between the Congress and the executive branch,
4 and we don't intend to.
5 Ambassador Yovanovitch has been subpoenaed to testify,
6 and as we read the law, she is obliged to be here and
7 testify, and she wi11.	We have repeatedly asked the State
8 Department's office of the legal advisor to provide us with a
9 written statement that we could read on their behalf so that
10 their concer ns regarding what they term, quote, "execut i ve II		branch con f i d ential i ty interests," end quote, could be heard
12 by this committee.	We have asked them to specify in writing
13 particular topics with r espect to which they wish us to point
14 out their interests.	And although we were told we would
15 receive such a statement, we have not.
16 So that Ambassador Yovanovitch can be as diligent as
17 possible in complying with her employer's wishes, I will do
18 my best, during the course of this hearing, to point out
t9	questions that might elicit information that I understand to
20 fall within the scope of their concerns.	I wi l l also tell
21 you now that the Department told us that they don't want our
22 appearance today to be constru ed as a waiver of any
23 privileges they may hold.
24 I	want to be clear that I	am not asserting any of those
25 pr i v i leges on the client's behalf because, of course, we

27



don't have a right to assert those privileges at all.	If
2 they exist, they belong to the Department, and we will, of
3 course, make those objecti ons subject to whatever ruling the
4 chair chooses to make in the wake of those objections.
5 And with that on the record, I turn this over to counsel
6 for the majority.
7 THE CHAIRMAN:	Thank you.	Mr. Goldman.
8 MR. GOLDMAN:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.	Thank you for
9 that opening statement, Ambassador Yovanovitch.	I think
10 everyone recognizes and appreciates your long service to this
II	country.
12 EXAMINATION
13 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
14 Q	We are going to get into the circumstances
15 surrounding your abrupt removal, but in order, I think, to
16 fully understand that, we need to back up a little bit.	And
17 I want to focus at the outset on press reports and other
18 indications of Rudy Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine.
19 When did you first become aware that Rudy Giuliani had
20 an interest in or was communicating with anyone in Ukraine?
21 A	Probably around November , December timeframe of 22	2018.
23 Q	And describe those circumstances when you first
24 learned about it.
25 A	Basically, it was people in the Ukrainian

28




Government who said that Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor
2 general, was in communi cat i on with Mayor Giuliani, and that
3 they had plans, and that they were go i ng to, you know, do
4 th i ng s, including to me.
5 Q	So you first heard about it from the Ukrainian
6 officials?
7 A	That' s correct.
8 Q	Did you understand how they were aware of this
9 information?
10 A	So I can tell you what I think, you know, this is
II	perhaps not a fact.	But the i mpre ssi on that I received is
12 that Mr. Lutsenko was talking rather freely about this in,
13 you know, certain circles, and so others heard about it who
14 wanted to let us know.
1 5	THE CHAIRMAN:	Can you move the microphone a little
16 closer.
17 MS. YOVANOVITCH:	Sorry.
}8	BY MR. GOLDMAN:
19 Q	Were these Ukrainian Government officials?

20 A
21 Q

Yes.
Can you describe for us who the former Prosecutor

22 Ge ner al Lutsenko i s, and give us some context as to his
23 background and what your assessment of him is?
24 A	Yeah , he's a Ukrainian politician.	He' s been in
25 politics I would say, probably, the last 20 years or so, and

29



he has held many high government positions.	He's a political
2 ally of former Presi dent	Poroshenko, or at least was until
3 the time I left, I don't know where that status is now.	And
4 he is a man who was the head of the Poroshenko faction and
5 the Rada, which is the Ukrainian parliament, until the spring
6 of 2016 when he was voted in to become the prosecutor
7 general.
8 Q	Is he a lawyer?
9 A	No.
IO	Q	So how did he become the prosecutor general?
II	A	Because the Rada had to take a prior vote that
12 would allow that exception, which I believe is act ually even
13 in the constitution, either cons titut i on or law.
14 4	Q	So he was the prosecutor genera l the entire time
15 that you were in Ukraine.	Is that right?


16 A

17 Q

That's correct.
And can you just describe bri efly what the role of

18 the prosecutor general is in Ukra i ne?
19 A	Yes.	And because Uk r a i ne is a country in
20 transition, that role was i n the process of becoming
21 reformed.	So the prosecutor general ' s office i s, or
22 position, is a very powerfu l one, it's a hold-over from the
23 Soviet Union days.	And that individual is in cha rg e of both
24 investigatory actions, like the FBI, for example, as well as
25 the actual prosecution.	So it' s tremendous power.



30




And Mr. Lut senko was bro ught in to reform that off i ce to
2 spl i t the off i ces , investigatory and prosecuto r i al , a nd to
3 make real reform s so that -- because the PGO, Prosecutor
4 Gene ral ' s Offi ce , was v i ewed as an instrument of corruption
5 bas i cally , to grant people favors, they cou l d open cases,
6 t hey could close cases based on money pass i ng hands or
7 whatever was most opportune, and it trickled down to the
8 ordin ary people ' s lives as well.	So it was seen as a place

9 where ironically co r rupt i on thrived and he was brought	in to
10 clean that up.
11 Q	Was he successful in clean i ng that up?
12 A	No.
13 Q	How would you assess his character?
14 A	He's very smart.	He can be very charming.	He , I
15 th i nk , i s an opportunist and will ally h i msel f , somet i mes
16 si multane ously, I believe, with whatever pol i ti cal or
17 econom i c forces he believes will suit his i nte r ests best at
18 the ti me .

19 Q
20 A

Would you call him someone who is corrupt?
I have cer ta i nly heard a lot of people call him

21 co r r upt , and there are certainly a lot of stories about his
22 actions that would indicate that.
23 Q	You mentioned in your opening statement that the re
24 were false statements that were spread about you .	Was he one
25 of the i nd i v i dua ls who spread those false statements about

31



you?
2 A	Yes.
3 Q	Now, let's go back to first learning about Rudy
4 Gi ul i an i 's involvement.	What did you understand in late 2018
5 to be Mr. Giuliani's interest in Ukraine?
6 A	I wasn't really sure, but he had cli ent s in
7 Ukraine, so that was one possible th i ng .	But he also
8 obviously is the Pre si dent 's personal lawyer.	So I wasn't
9 really sur e what exactly was going on.


10

11	was?
12

Q	Did you come to lea r n what his i nt erest in Ukraine


A	Well, you know, I read the press and watch TV just


13 like everybody else in this room, so yeah, I learned.
14 Q	Did you have any further con ver sat i ons with
15 Ukrainian Government officials about Mr. Giuliani's
16 activities in Ukraine?
17 A	Yes, I did.	Most of the conversations were not
18 with me directly, people on the embassy staff, but yes, I did
19 have othe r conversat i ons.
20 Q	And from your staff members or your own
21 conversations, what did you come to learn about
22 Mr. G i ulian i ' s interest in Ukraine?
23 A	That basically there had been a number of meetings
24 between Mr. Lut senk o and Mayor Giuliani, and that they were
25 l ook i ng -- I should say that Mr. Lutsenko was looking to hurt

32




me in the U.S.	I couldn't imagine what that was.	But, you
2 know, now I see.
3 Q	What do you see now?
4 A	Well, that I'm no longer in Ukraine.
5 Q	Fair enough.	But describe the evolution of your
6 understanding as to how Mr. Lutsenko was trying to hurt you
7 in the U.S.?
8 A	I think, and again, I am getting this partly from
9 conversations with people who may or may not know what really
10 happened, as well as what has been in the media, both in
11 Ukraine and here in the United States.	So I' ll tell you what
12 I think.	I can't say that --
13 Q	Let me just interrupt you there.	Is some of your
14 knowledge based on Mr. Giuliani's statements himself?
15 A	To the press.
16 Q	Okay.
17 A	So I th i nk tha t there was -- Mr. Lutsenko was not
18 pleased that	that we continued at the embassy to call for
19 cleaning up the PGO. the Prosecutor General's Office, and he
20 came into office with, you know. three goals:	One was to
21 reform the office, one was to prosecute those who killed the
22 innocent people on the Maidan during the Revolut i on of
23 Dignity, and one was to prosecute money laundering cases to
24 get back the $40 billion-plus that the previous president and
25 his cronies had absconded with.	None of those things were

33



done.	And we thought those were great goals. and we wanted
2 him to encourage him to continue with those goals.	That did
3 not happen.
4 And so. we continued to encourage him, and I don't think
5 he r eally appreciated it.	What he wanted from the U.S.
6 Embassy was for us to set up meetings wi th the Attorney
7 General, with the Director of the FBI , et cetera.	And he
8 would say, I have important information for them.	As perhaps
9 many of you know, there are, you know, usual processes for
10 that kind of thing.	We don't have principals meet and, you
11 know, the foreign principal springs new information that may
12 or may not be valid to an American cabinet member, we just
13 don ' t do that.
14 And so what we kept on encouraging him to do was to meet
15 wi th the legat, the legal attache, the FBI at the embassy.
16 That is precisely why we have the FBI in countries overseas,
17 to work with host country counterparts and get information,
18 whatever that information might be, develop cases, et cetera.
19 He didn't want to share that i nf ormat i on.	And now, I think I
20 understand that that information was falsehoods about me.
21 Q	What falsehoods about you?
22 A	Well, for example, as I mentioned i n the testimony,
23 in the statement, the opening statement, that I gave him a
24 do-not-prosecute list, a list of individuals that he should
25 not touch.

34




Q	And did you do that?

2 A	No.
3 Q	Did you learn whether there was any additional
4 i nf ormat i on that he wanted to share wi th U.S. Government
5 off i ci als ?
6 A	Well, I think, you know, it was other th i ngs along

7 that li ne.
8 Q	One of the things that has been publicized quite

9 si gni f i cantly is information that Prosecuto r General Lutsenko
10	may have had i n connect i on to ei ther Paul Manafort or the
11 2016 election?
12 A	Uh- huh .
1 3	Q	Did you come to learn anything about either of
14 those topics?
15 A	He d i dn ' t share anything with me.
16 Q	Did he share anything with any other Ukra i ni an
17 officials that you then learned about it from, or learned
18 about this f rom?
19 A	I think, yeah, I th i nk they may have been aware
20 that that was more broadly what he also might sh are with
21 M r. Giuliani. .
22 Q	Well, let me ask the question this way:	Other than

23 i nformat i on about you --
24 A	Uh-huh .
25 Q	-- what other information did you come to learn

35



while you were at post about what Mr. Lutsenko wanted to
2 share with American officials?
3 MR. ROBBINS:	So you're asking now while she was
4 ambassador as opposed to things she' s read in the paper and
5 media since she was recalled?
6 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
7 Q	Yes, I'm asking while you were there, what did you
8 understand?
9 A	Yeah, it was very amorphous, because while there
10 was sort of that gossip out there, the gossip that I was
11 going to be recalled, and you know, people would ask me, and
12 I' d say No, no, I' m he re, I' m worki ng.	But i t was ve ry
I 3	amorphous, and so at the time, I d i dn 't know.	When i t became
14 clearer was on March 24th with the publication of The Hill
15 interview with Mr. Lutsenko.
16 So that, you know , that was sort of the first kind of
17 public, on the record, in the United States, and then over
18 the ensuing days there was more in the U.S. media,
19 Mr. Gi ul i an i spoke publ i cly , and Donald Trump Jr. also
20 tweeted that I should be rem oved .
21 Q	So let's separate out your removal from any of the
22 other information.
23 A	Okay.
24 Q	Because we are going to get to your removal , and
25 we're goi ng to focus on that.	But just to get the lay of the

36




land here.	What did you -- when you referenced The Hill,
2 what did you come to learn from The Hill about information
3 that Lutsenko was trying to share?
4 A	Well, I   think, I mean, I th i nk. I've already told
5 you.	So he shared information that there was -- he raised

6 questions -- again, this happened before I arrived, but he
7 raised questions about U.S. Government assistance to the PGO,
8 and whether there was a discrepancy in the funding and
9 whether he should be investigating it, and that the embassy
10 had assured him, again, before I arrived, that we had fully
11 accounted for all U.S. funds, and that we were not concerned
12 about this.	So that was one line that he talked about.
13 There was the do-not-prosecute list.	There was. I mean, you
14 know, a number of issues.
15 Q	Was there anything about the 2016 election or Paul
16 Manafort?
17 A	I	think, yeah, I	think that was in The Hill article

18 as well.
19 Q	And what about former Vice President Joe Biden or
20 Burisma?
21 A	I think that was in the article as well.
22 Q	So after you learned about this in The Hill, did
23 you have any additional conversations with people, either
24 Americans in the embassy, or Ukrainian officials about the
25 reports?

37



A	Well, in the embassy we were trying to figure out
2 what was going on.	I also, of course, was in touch with
3 folks in Washington at the NSC, and at the State Department
4 to try to figure out what was this, what was going on.
5 Q	What did you learn?
6 A	Not much.	I mean, I think people were not sure.
7 On the 25th, the day after The Hill article came out, the
8 State Department had a pretty strong statement that said that
9 Mr. Lutsenko's allegations were a fabr i cat i on, and then, you
10 know, over the weekend, there was a lot more in the media.
11 And, you know, the State Department was trying to figure out
12 how to respond, I think, during that time and the following
13 week.	But I didn't get very much information.
14 Q	At that point, were you aware that Mr. Gi ul i an i had
15 met with Mr. Lutsenko previous ly?
16 A	Yeah, I think it became pretty clear.
17 Q	What do you mean by that?
18 A	Because I think it was in the media, and I think
19 they said it.
20 Q	So at this point, just so we' re clear.	Mr.
21 Giuliani was never an employee of the State Department,
22 right?
23 A	Not to my knowledge.
24 Q	You said that you met with him, I think, three
25 times.	Can you describe those meetings?

38




A	Uh-huh.
2 THE CHAIRMAN :	Just ask -- before we get to that,
3 counse l.	Did you know at the time or have you learned since
4 why Mr. Lutsenko was engaged in pushing out these smears
5 against you?	Why did he want to get rid of you?
6 MS. Y0VAN0VI TCH:	Well, again, I can tell you what I
7 think, but I don't know for a fact.
8 THE CHAIRMAN:	You know, based on what you' ve learned
9 from colleagues, what you've learned in the press, what is
10 your best understanding of why Lutsenko was tr y i ng to push II	you out of Ukraine?
12 MS. Y0VA N0V ITCH:	I think that he felt that I and the
13 embassy were effective at helping Ukrainians who wanted to
14 reform, Ukrainians who wanted to fight against co rrupt i on ,
15 and he did not -- you know , that was not in his interest.	I
16 th i nk also that he was, I mean, i t's hard to bel i eve , I think
17 he was personally angry with me that we weren't -- we did
18 work with the PGO's office, but he wanted us to work with him
19 in different ways, you know. and that we d i dn' t have a closer
20 relationship, and that I was not facilitating trips for him
21 to the United States with our cabinet members, when there
22 was, frankly, nothing to tal k about because he wasn't a good
23 partner for us.
24 THE CHAIRMAN:	You had mentioned earli er that you were
25 try i ng to make sure that Ukrainian officials used proper

39




legal channels --
2 MS. YOVANOVITCH:
3 THE CHAIRMAN:



Yes.
if they had information that they

4 wanted to share with U.S. law enforcement?
5 MS. YOVANOVITCH:	Right.
6 THE CHAIRMAN:	Do you think that your insistence or
7 advocacy for following the proper procedures in terms of
8 using legat and legal channels was part of the reason why he
9 wanted you removed?
10 MS. YOVANOVITCH:	Maybe.	Maybe.	I mean , he clearly
11 wanted to work around the system where I think there's less
12 transparency, there are more opportunities to, you know, kind
13 of	fiddle the system, shall we say.
1 4	BY MR. GOLDMAN :
15 Q	Okay.	And when you say work around the system , did
16 you come to understand that that was a role that Mr. Giuliani
17 could play for him, for Mr. Luts enko?
18 A	Well, now it certainly appears that way.
19 Q	But when did you come to understand that?
20 A	You know, now, you know, with the advantage of
21 hindsight, you're going to think that I'm incredibly naive,
22 but I couldn ' t imagine all of the things that have happened
23 over the last 6 or 7 months, I just couldn't im ag i ne it.
24 So we knew that there was something out there.	We were
25 ask i ng ourselves, you know, what is going on?	But then it

40




became clear with The Hill interview and all the subsequent
2 things that came out in the press.
3 Q	So the State Department issued a statement
4 essentially denying what was reported in The Hill?
5 A	Uh - huh .
6 Q	Did you ever receive any pressure from anyone at
7 the State Department to reconsider your position or in any
8 way consider some of the advocacy of Mr. Giuliani?
9 A	I don't quite understand the
10 Q	I'm wondering if you got any messages or
I I	suggestions or directions from the State Department that were
12 consistent with what Mr. Giuliani was discussing and what his
13 interests were?
14

15
16 information came out in The Hill in late March, you had a
17 number of conversations both with people in the embassy and
18 people back in Washington.	Who were you speaking to within
19 the State Department about this issue?
20 A	Assistant Secretary -- or Acting Assistant
21 Secretary Phil Reeker of the European Bureau, who is my boss.
22 I spoke once with David Hale, who is the Under Secretary for
23 Political Affairs.	And at the NSC with Fiona Hill.
24 Q	And what was the message that you generally
25 received from them?

41



A	Total support.
2 Q	They understood that this was a fabrication?
3 A	Yeah, I mean, until today, nobody has ever actually

4 asked me the question from the U.S. Government of whether I
5 am actually guilty of all of these things I'm supposed to
6 have done.	Nobody even asked, because I think everybody just
7 thought it was so outrageous.
8 Q	Did you ever have any	conversations after November,
9	December 2018, with Ukrainian offi c i als about Mr. Giuliani up
10	until the time that you left in May?
II A	I think perhaps in the February ti me period, I did
12 where one of the senior Ukrainian officials was very
13 concerned, and told me I really needed to watch my back .


14 4	Q
15 A

Describe that conversation.
Well, I mean, he basically said, and went into some

16 detail, that there were two i nd i viduals	from Florida,
17 Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were working with Mayor
18 Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for
19 Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Lutsenko.	And that they were
20 i nterested	in having a different ambassador at post, I guess
21 for -- because they wanted to have business dealings in
22 Ukraine, or additional business dealings.
23 I didn't understand that because nobody at the embassy
24 had ever met those two individuals.	And, you know , one of
25 the biggest jobs of an American ambassador of the U.S.

2 BY MR. GOLDMAN:
3 Q	So your understanding in February and your meeting
4 with Minister Avakov was that he was aware at that time of
5 Mr. Giuliani's interests in those topi cs?

6 A	Yes.
7 Q	Did you have an understanding as to whether other

8 Ukrainian Government officials were also aware of
9 Mr. Giuliani's i nterest	in those specific topics?
10 A	I -- I got the impression that it was relatively
II	openly discussed at the very, very most senior levels, but
12 nobody else was sharing this with me at that time.
13 Q	And so, was it your understand i ng that the Minister
14 Avakov or other senior Ukrainian officials were aware of

15 Mr. Giuliani's connection to President Trump?
16 A	Yes, everybody knew that.
17 Q	What did they know?
18 A	That he was the Pre si dent's	personal lawyer.
19 Q	Was i t your understanding that they believed that
20 Rudy Giuliani spoke on behalf of, or for the President?
21 A	I think -- I think they didn't know.	I think they

22 hoped that he did, and


23 Q
24 A

Hoped that he did or didn't?
Hoped -- well, the individuals who were meeting


25 with Mr. Giuliani certainly hoped that Mr. Giuliani was
