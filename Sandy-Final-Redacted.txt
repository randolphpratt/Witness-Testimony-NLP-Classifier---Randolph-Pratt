1 MR. SWALWELL:	Good morning, Mr. Sandy, counsel, and colleagues,
2 and welcome to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,
3 which, along with the Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees, is
4 conducting this investigation as a part of the official impeachment
5 inquiry of the House of Representatives.
6 Today's deposition is being conducted as a part of the impeachment
7 inquiry.	In light of attempts by the Office of Management and Budget
8 and the administration to direct you to not cooperate with the inquiry,
9 the committee had no choice but to compel your appearance.	We thank
10 you for complying with the duly authorized congressional subpoena, as
11 other current and former officials from across the Federal Government
12 have done.
13 Mr. Sandy is currently the Deputy Associate Director for National
14 Security Programs at the Office of Management and Budget, a position
15 that he has held since 2013.	He was also the Acting Director of 0MB
16 in 2017 until a new 0MB Director was confirmed.
17 His over two decades of public service have included roles as the
18 managing director of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an
19 independent U.S foreign assistance agency established by Congress in
20 2004 with strong bipartisan support, and staffing three White Houses
21 of both Democratic and Republican Presidents.	Mr. Sandy also served
22 over 21 years in the Navy Reserve, under 11 Secretaries and Acting
23 Secretaries of Defense.
24 Mr. Sandy, thank you again for your service.	We look forward to
25 your testimony today, including your knowledge of and involvement in

UNCLASSIFIED

6
UNCLASSIFIED


1 key policy discussions, meetings, and decisions on Ukraine that relate
2 directly to areas under investigation by the committees.
3 Today, we will be primarily focusing on the administration's
4 placement of a hold on Ukrainian security assistance in the summer of
5 this year through the lifting of the hold on September 11.	We will
6	also have question about OMB's response to the impeachment inquiry,
7 including the committee's subpoena which 0MB continues to defy despite
8 the fact that we know that it has already collected significant
9 documentary evidence that goes to the heart of our inquiry.
10 Finally, to restate what our chairman and others have emphasized
11 in these interviews, Congress will not tolerate any reprisal, threat
12 of reprisal, or any attempt to retaliate against any U.S. Government
13 official for testifying before Congress, including you or any of your
14 colleagues.
15 It is disturbing that the Office of Management and Budget, in
16 coordination with the White House, has sought to prohibit its employees
17 from cooperating with the inquiry and with Congress and have tried to
18 limit what they can say.	We find this unacceptable.
19 Thankfully, consummate public servants like you have
20 demonstrated remarkable courage in coming forward to testify and to
21 tell the truth.
22 Before I turn to committee counsel to begin the interview, I
23 invite the ranking member or, in the absence of a ranking member, any
24	member of the Foreign Affairs or Oversight Committee to make an opening
25	remark.

1 Mr. Jordan?
2 MR. JORDAN:	Thank you, Mr. Chairman.	I just wanted to welcome

3 Mr. Sandy.
4 And, again, thank you for your service to the country.
5 MR. SWALWELL:	Mr. Mitchell?

6 MS. VAN GELDER:	He would just like to say two sentences.
7 MR. MITCHELL:	Well, I am going to go over the preamble first,

8 and then he can have any opening remarks he wishes.
9 MS. VAN GELDER:	Thank you.
10 MR. MITCHELL:	This is the deposition of Mark Sandy conducted by
11 the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, or HPSCI,
12 pursuant to the impeachment inquiry announced by the Speaker of the
13 House on September 24th.
14 Mr. Sandy, please state your full name and spell your last name
15 for the record.
16 MR. SANDY:	Mark Steven Sandy, S-a-n-d-y.
17 MR. MITCHELL:	Along with other proceedings in furtherance of the
18 inquiry to date, this deposition is part of a joint investigation led
19 by the Intelligence Committee in coordination with the Committees on
20 Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform.
21 In the room today are majority staff and minority staff from all
22 three committees, and this will be a staff-led deposition.	Members
23 of course may ask questions during their allotted time, as has been
24 the case in every deposition since the inception of this investigation.
25 My name is Nicolas Mitchell, senior investigative counsel for

UNCLASSIFIED

8
UNCLASSIFIED


1 HPSCI.	I want to thank you for coming in today to this deposition.
2 I'd like to do brief introductions.	To my right is Daniel
3 Goldman, director of investigations for the HPSCI majority staff.
4 Mr. Goldman and I will be conducting most of the interview for the
s	majority.
6 I will let my counterparts from the minority introduce
7 themselves.
8 MR. CASTOR:	Good morning.	Steve Castor with the Republican
9 staff of the Oversight Committee and HPSCI.
10	         
11	

12	-

13	-
14 MR. MITCHELL:	This deposition will be conducted entirely at the
15 unclassified level.	However, the deposition is being conducted in
16 HPSCI's secure spaces and in the presence of staff with appropriate
17 security clearances.	We understand that your attorneys also have
18 security clearances?

19 MS. VAN GELDER:	No.
20 MR. MITCHELL:	No.

21 Nevertheless, it's the committees' expectation that neither
22 questions asked of you nor answers provided by you will require a
23 discussion of any information that is currently or at any point could
24 be properly classified under Executive Order 13526.
25 You're reminded that E.O. 13526 states that in no case shall

UNCLASSIFIED

9
UNCLASSIFIED


1	information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified,
2	or fail to be declassified for the purpose of concealing any violations
3 of law or preventing embarrassment of any person or entity.
4 If any of our questions can only be answered with classified
5 information, please inform us of that and we will adjust accordingly.
6 Today's deposition is not being taken in executive session, but
7	because of the sensitive and confidential nature of some of the topics
8	and materials that will be discussed, access to the transcript of the
9	deposition will be limited to the three committees in attendance.
10 Under the House deposition rules, no Member of Congress nor any
11 staff member can discuss the substance of the testimony you provide
12 today.
13 You and your attorney will have an opportunity to review the
14 transcript.
15 Before we begin, I would like to go over the ground rules for this
16 deposition.	We will be following the House regulations for
17 depositions, which we have previously provided to your counsel.
18 The deposition will proceed as follows.	The majority will be
19 given 1 hour to ask questions; then the minority will be given 1 hour
20 to ask questions.	Thereafter, we will alternate back and forth between
21 majority and minority in 45-minute rounds until questioning is
22 complete.	We will take periodic breaks, but if you need a break at
23 any time, do let us know.
24 Under the House deposition rules, counsel for other persons or
25 government agencies may not attend.	You are permitted to have an

UNCLASSIFIED

10
UNCLASSIFIED


1 attorney present during the deposition, and I see you have brought some.
2 At this time, if counsel could please state their appearance for
3 the record.

4 MS. VAN GELDER:	Barbara Van Gelder, Cozen O'Connor.
5 MS. WILLIAMS:	Karen Williams, Cozen O'Connor.
6 MS. KAUFFMAN:	Allegra Kauffman, Cozen O'Connor.
7 MS. VAN GELDER:	Training session.
8 MR. MITCHELL:	There is a stenographer taking down everything

9 that is said here today in order to make a written record of the
10 deposition.	For the record to be clear, please wait until each
11 question is completed before you begin your answer and we will wait
12 until you finish your response before asking the next question.
13 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal answers such as shaking
14 your head, so it's important that you answer each question with an
15 audible verbal answer.
16 We ask that you give complete replies to questions based on your
17 best recollection.	If a question is unclear or you are uncertain in
18 your response, please let us know.	And if you do not know the answer
19 to a question or cannot remember, simply say so.
20 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege
21 recognized by the committee.	If you refuse to answer a question on
22 the basis on privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition
23 or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection.	If the chair
24 overrules any such objection, you're required to answer the question.
25 Finally, you're reminded that it is under lawful to deliberately

UNCLASSIFIED

11
UNCLASSIFIED


1 provide false information to Members of Congress or staff.	It is
2 imperative that you not only answer our questions truthfully but that
3 you give full and complete answers to all questions asked of you.
4 Omissions may also be considered as false statements.
5 As this deposition is under oath, Mr. Sandy, would you please
6 stand and raise your right hand to be sworn?
7 Do you swear that your testimony provided here today will be the
8 whole truth and nothing but the truth?
9 MR. SANDY:	I do.
10 MR. MITCHELL:	Let the record reflect that the witness has been
11 sworn.
12 You may be seated.
13 Mr. Sandy, if you have an opening statement or your attorney has
14 any matters to discuss, now would be the time.
15 MR. SANDY:	Thank you.
16 Ladies and gentleman, I am here today as a fact witness and as
17 a nonpartisan civil servant and military veteran who proudly serves
18 the Executive Office of the President across administrations. I am
19 not here to advocate for any outcome but simply to honor the oath we
20 all share.
21 Thank you.
22 MR. SWALWELL:	All right.	Mr. Mitchell?
23 MR. MITCHELL:	Thank you.	We will now begin our 1-hour first
24 round.
25 BY MR. MITCHELL:

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED



1QSo, Mr. Sandy, what's your current title?2ADeputy Associate Director for National Security at the3	Office of Management and Budget.4QOkay.	And how long have you had that title?5ASince December of 2013.6QAnd when did you start working for OMB?7AInitially, I began in 1993.	I worked there until 1997 and
8 then returned in 2011.
9 Q	So I take it that you are a career civil servant, not a
10 political appointee, in your current post.	Is that correct?


11 A

12 Q

Yes, sir.
Okay.	Can you just generally describe the organizational


13 structure of your particular division or group at OMB?
14 A	Certainly.	I lead the National Security Division, which
15 includes four branches.	And we have responsibility for overseeing the
16 budget and programs of the Department of Defense, the National Nuclear
17 Security Administration, the Intelligence Community, and the
18 Department of Veterans Affairs principally, as well as a few small
19 agencies.


20 Q

21 A

Okay.	And what is above the National Security Division? The Associate Director, who leads the so-called Resource

22 Management Organization, or RMO.
23 Q	And who is that?


24 A

25 Q

Mr. Michael Duffey.
And is that your immediate supervisor?

UNCLASSIFIED

13
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	Yes.
2 Q	Okay.	And how many people do you have working below you in

3 the National Security Division?
4 A	Approximately 35 when we are fully staffed, give or take a
5 few detailees.
6 Q	Okay.	And just generally, without going into too much
7 detail, can you just describe your duties and responsibilities in your
8 current position?
9 A	In my position, I lead the division.	The division, overall,
10 is responsible for overseeing the agencies and departments that I
11 mentioned, in terms of their budgets and programs and policy priorities
12 of the administration.
13 Q	Okay.	And before I forget, Mr. Duffey, who's your
14 supervisor, is he a career civil servant or is he a political appointee?
15 A	Political.
16 Q	Okay.	In your current role, have you ever had any
17 responsibilities with regard to apportionments?


18 A

19 Q

20 A

Yes.
And are you familiar with the term II apportionment official 11 ? We don't use that term very often, but -- if you mean the

21 individual who is responsible for approving apportionments?
22 Q	Yes, okay.	Were you an apportionment -- did you have the
23 responsibility of approving apportionments at any given time during
24 this current role?
25 A	Yes, I did.

UNCLASSIFIED

14
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Okay.	Generally, what is an apportionment?
2 A	An apportionment is a legal document, consistent with
3 provisions in Title XXXI of U.S. Code, which basically sets parameters
4 on agencies' use of appropriated funds.
5 Q	So, once funds are appropriated by Congress, is an
6 apportionment required for those funds to be spent?
7 A	Yes.	With very few exceptions, for nearly all accounts, an
8 apportionment is required.
9 Q	And, just generally, what does an apportionment look like?
10 It's a physical document, presumably?
11 A	Well, when printed -- most of our work is now electronic,
12 of course, but when printed, it would have basically columns of
13 information about budgetary sources and then the application or uses
14 of those sources, as well as a number of accompanying -- if you look
15 at it as a spreadsheet, you would have accompanying tabs with footnotes,
16 for example, a signature block, et cetera.
17 Q	Okay.	And, again, during this current role, there was a time
18 where you were responsible for signing apportionments.	Is that
19 correct?


20 A

21 Q

For approving them, yes.
Approving them and physically signing them?


22 A	The signature is automatically loaded into the system, so
23 it will appear on any apportionment that I approved.
24 Q	Okay.	Can you just generally describe the process for
25 reviewing and approving apportionments?

UNCLASSIFIED

15
UN CLASSIFIED


1 A	The agency typically submits a request, which comes into us
2 electronically. It would have an agency request column, and then it
3 will have a separate column for 0MB action.
4 The examiner -- and that's the staff level at 0MB -- would first
5 review that apportionment request, go back to the agency with any
6 questions, and then, when he or she had completed their review, would
7 route that forward to a branch chief, who would conduct a review and
8 then route it forward to the approving official.
9 Q	Okay.	And the examiner and branch chief, are those among
10 the 35 individuals that you oversee?

11ACorrect.12QAnd when you said the approving official, here we're talking13 about you, correct?


14 A

15 Q

Previously, yes.
Okay.	And you indicated that the examiner, he or she, might


16 consult with the agencies that are submitting the request?
17 A	Certainly.
18 Q	Okay.	Can you just generally describe the nature of those
19 conversations, how that back-and-forth would work?
20 A	Well, the examiners have contacts at their respective
21 agencies.	And so, if they had questions or concerns about the
22 requested allocation of funds - - so, for example, a common allocation
23 would be an allocation across the four quarters of the fiscal year.
24 And if an examiner was concerned about ensuring that enough resources
25 were left for, say, the fourth quarter, the examiner may ask how the

UNCLASSIFIED

16
UNCLASSIFIED


1 agency came up with the allocations that it's requesting.
2 Q	Okay.	And would those communications between the examiner
3 and the agency typically be documented in one form or another?
4 A	It really depends.	There could be email que stions and
5 answers, or it could simply be a phone call.
6 Q	Okay.	And then you indicated that the examiner would then
7 provide some sort of report or recommendation to the branch chief?


8 A

9 Q

10 A

Correct.
And what form would that take?
That would be an electronic note with whatever information


11 the examiner deemed relevant that would be routed forward in our online
12 system.


13 Q

14 A

15 Q

What's the name of your online system?
MAX.
Do the examiners communicate with branch chiefs about their


16 review solely through MAX, or could it also be done through email as
17 well?
18 A	It could also be done via email, but MAX auto-generates
19 emails to alert people that information is awaiting their action.
20 Q	Okay.	So if an examiner had any concerns about a particular
21 request by an agency, would those be reflected in the MAX system?
22 A	They could be.	It depends on how the examiner chooses to
23 communicate that information.


24 Q

25 A

Well, where else could it be?
It could also be in an email or in a conversation .

UNCLASSIFIED

17
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Okay.	Once the branch chief receives, either through email,
2 the MAX system, or some sort of oral communication, an examiner's report
3 or concerns, what does the branch chief do next?
4 A	The branch chief has responsibility for reviewing the
5 apportionment, a second review and, again, if the branch chief has
6 questions, going back to the examiner, or if he or she supports the
7 apportionment, routing it forward.
8 Q	Okay.	So it's an iterative process between a branch chief
9 and the examiner, or it can be?
10 A	It can be.	The branch chief has authority, for example, to
11 basically send an apportionment back to an examiner or route it forward.
12 Q	Okay.	And then, once the branch chief -- or how does the
13 branch chief go about routing it forward?


14 A

15 Q

16 A

That, again, would be within the electronic MAX system. Okay.	Also through email as well, possibly?
Again, if the branch chief wanted to communicate additional


17 information, email is an option, but the system auto-generates emails
18 to the approving official
19 Q	Okay.	So you, as the approving official, when you did have
20 that role --


21 A

22 Q

Yes.
-- would you see the recommendations of the branch chief as


23	well as the comments or recommendations of the lower-level examiners?


24 A

25 Q

Yes.
Okay.	Did you typically accept the recommendations of your

UNCLASSIFIED

18
UNCLASSIFIED


1 staff with regard to whether to approve an apportionment or not?
2 A	Generally.	The vast majority of apportionments are quite
3 routine.
4 Q	Okay.	Can you recall an instance when you disagreed with
5 your staff's recommendations?
6 A	Yes.
7 Q	Okay.	Without getting into specifies, necessarily, can you
8 just generally describe the circumstances under which you would
9 disagree or have questions about what was presented to you?
10 A	Well, one key example is, if you have an apportionment, you
11 cannot change the allocations for a previous quarter.	So if you're
12 in the second quarter of a fiscal year and the agency submits a request
13 and it changes the allocation for the first quarter, you can't do that.
14 So if the examiner or the branch chief didn't catch that error, I would
15 just catch the error and have it corrected.
16 Q	Okay.	All right.	And was that sort of thing a frequent
17 occurrence?
18 A	No.	Generally, by the time it reached the third level of
19 review, those sorts of issues have been resolved.
20 Q	It sounds like what you're describing is kind of more of a
21 technical issue that was mere oversight, not a larger issue that
22 required further consultation with any other entity within 0MB.	Is
23 that generally accurate?


24 A

25 Q

Generally, that's the case, yes. Okay.

UNCLASSIFIED




19
UNCLASSIFIED


1 What is OMB's Budget Review Division?
2 A	The Budget Review Division coordinates exercises across the
3 entire agency, particularly with respect to the development of the
4 annual President's budget, but it	also runs number of drills to collect
5 information, often at the behest of policy officials.	It also has
6 experts in many of our circulars	for example, Circular A-11.
7 Q	Okay.	To your knowledge, have you or branch chiefs or any
8 examiners ever consulted with OMB's Budget Review Division about
9 particular apportionments just to seek advice?


10 A

11 Q

Absolutely.
Okay.	And when you were responsible for reviewing and


12 approving apportionments, how often would you receive an apportionment
13 to approve?
14 A	I received hundreds every year.	And they came in large
15 tranches, depending upon, for example, when we had a new appropriation.
16 You could always expect heavy volume at the end of the fiscal year and
17 at the beginning of a fiscal year or around key events such as the
18 enactment of appropriations or a continuing resolution.
19 Q	Okay.	And when you received these apportionments, is it
20 fair to say that -- well, tell me.	Was it a matter of routine that
21 you would simply sign them?	Or would you carefully scrutinize them
22 and potentially have discussions with branch chief, examiners, and
23 others about the apportionments, if appropriate?
24 A	I'd certainly have discussions if I had questions or they
25 had flagged anything we needed to discuss.	But the vast majority of

UNCLASSIFIED

20
U N CLASSI	FIED


1 these are quite routine, particularly if you've done this -- you've
2 seen them before.
3 Q	Okay.
4 All right.	So today we're going to focus on two different types
5 of security assistance, specifically to Ukraine.	The first is the DOD
6 Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, USAI, and then the second is
7 the State -administered foreign military financing.
8 Can you just generally describe and compare USAI versus FMF?	And
9 I'm also going to ask you what your experience is with respect to both.
10 A	Okay.	Let me say at the start that FMF is not within the
11 purview of my division.	So I will not speak to that, because that is
12 handled by our counterpart division, the International Affairs
13 Division.	But I'm glad to speak to USAI.
14 USAI, as appropriated in the defense appropriations bill and as
15 authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act, broadly is
16 designed to provide training, equipment, and other forms of assistance
17 to Ukraine.	I know in fiscal year 2019 there was an appropriation for
18 $250 million.
19 Q	Okay.	I understand that your current role does not involve
20 FMF, but at any point during your career did you have any exposure to
21 FMF issues?
22 A	I previously worked in the International Affairs Division,
23 but FMF was not handled by my branch.
24 Q	Okay.	All right.
25 So you mentioned the $250 million in USAI funds for 2019.	Are

UNCLASSIFIED

21
UNCLASSIFIED


1 you generally aware of the congressional notifications that went out
2 with regard to this $250 million in 2019?
3 A	Yes.
4 Q	So the first notification was around March 5th.	Is that
5 correct?


6 A

7

8

10 Q

I recall the month of March.
[Majority Exhibit No. 1
             was marked for identification.] BY MR. MITCHELL:
I'm going to hand you exhibit No. 1.	Do you recognize what

11 this is, sir?


12 A
13 Q
14 A

Yes.
And what is it?
It looks to be a congressional notification consistent with


15 the statutory requirements vis-a-vis USA!.
16 Q	And this was for the first tranche of USA! aid in 2019.	Is
17 that correct?

18 A	Correct.
19 Q	Were you all
20 MS. VAN GELDER:	Excuse me.
21 Have you ever seen this before?
22 MR. SANDY:	I have not seen the actual document.	I'm just

23 recognizing it based upon doing a quick scan.
24 BY MR. MITCHELL:
25 Q	Okay, but you're familiar with the fact that there was a

UNCLASSIFIED




22
UNCL A SSI FIED


1 congressional notification for two different tranches of aid in 2019
2 related to USA!?

3 A	Yes.
4 Q	Okay.	And exhibit No. 1 is the first tranche.	Is that your

5 understanding?

6 A	Yes, that's my understanding.
7 Q	Okay.	Have you seen the congressional notification for the

8 second tranche?


9 A	I have not.

10

[Majority Exhibit No. 2
was marked for identification.]



12
13 Q

BY MR. MITCHELL:
Okay.	Well, just so the record is complete, I'm handing you


14 exhibit No. 2.
15 A	Thank you.
16 Q	And what's the date of this particular document?	There
17 should be two dates up at the top.
18 A	I see the dates stamped as May 23rd and May 28th.
19 Q	Okay.	And it's your understanding that there was a second
20 congressional notification, which was in the May time period, for the
21 second tranche of USA! funds.	Is that right?
22 A	Yes.
23 Q	Okay.	Are you aware of, generally, the interagency process
24 that led up to these two CNs?
25 A	I don't participate in the interagency process, so I don't

UNCLASSIFIED

23
UNCLASSIFIED


1 have detailed knowledge.
2 Q	Okay.	But are you aware of any concerns that were raised
3 either during the interagency process or during your time at 0MB during
4 the spring of 2019 that led up to either of these congressional
5 notifications regarding the CNs for the first and second tranche of
6 USA!?
7 A	I was not aware of anything prior to the notifications.
8 Q	To the best of your recollection, did 0MB issue any

9 apportionments for USA! funds between March, which was the first CN,
10 and mid-June of 2019?
11 A	The USA! funds are actually included in a larger account.

12 That account is the Defense-wide operation and maintenance account.
13 So we would have issued apportionments for that account earlier in the
14 fiscal year.
15 Q	Okay.	And do you know - - so can you distinguish between USA!
16 funds that would've been included in an apportionment versus the larger
17 funds that were in that account, or are they all commingled?

18 A .	They were commingled.
19 Q	Okay.
20 When did you first learn that security assistance funds related
21 to Ukraine were being withheld or might be withheld?
22 A	I'm just consulting my calendar.	I was on leave through July
23 17th.	I returned to the office on July 18th.	And I learned of that
24 shortly after my return, so I would say it was either July 18th or July
25	19th.

4 BY MR. MITCHELL:

5 Q	Okay.	When did you go on leave?
6 A	I was out of the office starting on Monday, July 8th.
7 Q	So you did not hear anything about Ukraine security

8 assistance possibly being on hold at any time during the month of June
9 or during that first week of July?

10ANo.11QDid you hear of any questions that were being raised by 0MB12 about Ukraine security assistance at the end of June or the beginning
13 of July?

14A	Yes.15Q	Can you describe what you heard?16A	I heard that the President had seen a media report and he17hadquestions about the assistance.18[Discussion off the record.]19BY MR.

15 Q
16 A

22 A	The email was directed to the Department of Defense, and I
23 received information the following day.

9 A

10 Q

And who was she? Deputy Comptroller.
Okay.	Is that someone that you communicate with as part of

11 your normal course of business?
12 A	Yes.
13 Q	Did you have any conversations with Ms. Mccusker following
14 this request by Mike Duffey?
15 A	She provided me with a hard-copy summary the following day.
16 Q	And when you say she provided you with a hard copy, she
17 physically gave you a hard copy?
18 A	She did, because she was attending a meeting at 0MB.
19 Q	Okay.	Did she ever send you any electronic communication
20 as well in response to Mike Duffey's email?
21 A	I only recall the hard copy.
22 Q	Okay.	And what was that hard copy?


23 A

24 Q

It was an overview of USAI.
Had you seen this overview before?	Was it a precooked

25 document?


UNCLASSIFIED

27
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	I hadn't seen it before, so I can't speak to its origin.
2 Q	Okay.	And what did you do with this hard-copy document that

3 Ms. Mccusker gave you?
4 A	We shared it with Mike Duffey.

5 Q	Who's "we"?


6 A	Sorry.
7 Q	Okay.
 
When I say "we," I generally refer to NSD staff. And how did you share it with him?	Did you physically

8 give it to him, or did you scan it and email it to him?
9 A	I recall he was out of the office that day, so I don't recall
10 exactly how it was shared.
11 Q	Okay.	Did you eventually have a conversation with
12 Mr. Duffey about the information that Ms. Mccusker gave you?
13 A	I don't recall a specific conversation on that.


14 Q

15 A

16 Q

What about email exchanges? Not that I recall.
Did Mr. Duffey come back to you with any additional


17 questions?
18 A	He came back to members of my staff.
19 Q	Okay.	Can you describe what you know about that?


20 A

21 Q

22 A

He had a number of followup questions related to the program. And what were those?
And I don't recall all the specifics, but more information


23 on the financial resources associated with the program, in particular.
24 Q	I don't -- what does that mean?
25 A	Oh, sorry.	It would be in terms of the history of the

UNCLASSIFIED

28
UNCLASSIFIED


1 appropriations, any more details about the intent of the program.

2 Q	And was that information provided to Mr. Duffey?
3 A	Yes.
4 Q	And how?
5 A	So one of my staff members provided that information

6 electronically.

7 Q	Were you copied on those emails?
8 A	Yes.
9 Q	Okay.

10 Are you aware that 0MB has received a subpoena from Congress for
11 documents related to some of the topics that you've already discussed
12 here today?
13 A	Yes.
14 Q	Have you undertaken any sort of efforts to gather documents
15 that might be relevant to the subpoena?
16 A	Those efforts within 0MB are led by our Office of the General
17 Counsel.
18 Q	Have you personally gone through any of your emails or other
19 records to find documents that might be responsive to the subpoena?
20 A	My understanding from counsel is that they --
21 [Discussion off the record.]
22 MR. SANDY:	I have not undertaken that in response to such a
23 request.
24 [Discussion off the record.]
25 MR. SANDY:	Sorry.	I just want to explain that when 0MB decides

UNCLASSIFIED


1 to collect information electronically, it is done centrally.
2 BY MR. MITCHELL:
3 Q	Okay.	Is it possible that you also -- well, have you seen
4 the subpoena that was issued?

5 A	I have seen the subpoena
6 Q	Okay.
7 A	-- yes.
8 Q	And so you're generally aware of the information that the
9 committees are seeking.	Is that correct?
10 A	Yes.


11 Q

12 A

Okay.	Do you generally keep hard-copy notes in your office? Some notes.	And we were advised to retain all that

13 information.
14 Q	Okay.	Do you know whether those notes -- did you provide
15 copies of those notes to anyone?


16 A

17 Q

18 A

19 Q

I have not been requested to do so.
Okay.	So they've been preserved.	Is that correct? Correct.
Okay.	But no one has actually collected them, to your


20 knowledge.
21 A	Correct.
22 Q	All right.
23 Now, you indicated that Mr. Duffey had some additional questions
24 and members of your staff provided additional information to him
25 electronically.	Is that correct?

UNCLASSIFIED

30
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	Correct.
2 Q	Okay.	Were you copied on those communications as well?
3 A	Well, I was copied on them, yes.
4 Q	Okay.	And did you have any conversation with Mr. Duffey

5 about any of the additional information that was provided to him?
6 A	Not that I recall.

7 Q	Do you know what Mr. Duffey did with that information?
8 A	I do not know.
9 Q	Do you know whether he provided that information back to the

10 White House?
11 A	I was not copied on any sharing of that information, so the
12 short answer is I don't know.
13 Q	Okay.	Well, have you had any conversations with anyone
14 about whether Mr. Duffey shared that information with the White House?


15 A

16 Q

I do not recall. Okay.	All right.

17 So Mr. Duffey has these questions on June 19th, and there is a
18 back-and-forth between Mr. Duffey -- a request from Mr. Duffey to DOD.
19 Is that correct?


20 A

21 Q

The initial request was to DOD, yes.
And DOD responds through you with this hard-copy document,


22 correct?

23ACorrect.24QAnd then Mr. Duffey asks for additional information, which25	your staff then gathers and submits to Mr. Duffey.	Is that right?

UNCLASSIFIED




31
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	Correct.
2 Q	And you don't have any conversations with Mr. Duffey about

3 any of these requests, either on email or in person or over the phone,
4 during this time period?

5 A	I don't recall the specifics.
6 Q	Okay.	So Mr. Duffey never provided any more color on what

7 the President had concerns about or questions about with regard to USA!?
8 A	Later he did.
9 Q	Okay.	When was that?
10 A	When I returned from leave July 18th, I was informed of the
11 President's direction to hold military support funding for Ukraine.


12 Q

13 A

14 Q

15 A

16 Q

17 A

18 Q

Who communicated that to you? Mike Duffey.
How?
I recall a conversation.
Can you describe that conversation?
He communicated that that was the direction he had received. Okay.	I want to know everything that you can possibly recall

19 about that conversation with Mr. Duffey on or about July 18th or 19th
20 in which he told you that the President had decided to put a hold on
21 Ukraine security assistance.
22 A	Okay.	On the 19th, he shared that he had communicated this
23 direction to the Department of Defense.
24 Q	"He" being Mr. Duffey?
25 A	I'm sorry.	Yes.	Mr. Duffey.

UNCLASSIFIED

32
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Okay.
2 A	He also expressed a desire to create an apportionment that
3 would implement the hold.

4 Q	What else?
5 A	And he --

6 MS. VAN GELDER:	Go ahead.	Are you done?
7 Are you ready?
8 MR. GOLDMAN:	I am.
9 MS. VAN GELDER:	Any more dentist jokes over there?
10 MR. SANDY:	And we had a conversation about that request on Friday

11 the 19th.
12 MR. SWALWELL:	Mr. Sandy, where was the conversation?
13 MR. SANDY:	I recall a conversation in the Eisenhower Executive
14 Office Building.	And then he also followed up with me by phone later
15 that day, on the 19th.
16 MR. SWALWELL:	So the first conversation was on July 19 in the
17 EEOB.	Is that right?
18 MR. SANDY:	I returned on the 18th, and so I don't recall exactly
19 what happened on the 18th versus the 19th in terms of getting caught
20 up after having been on leave for nearly 2 weeks.	But I do recall
21 specifically the nature of that request.
22 MR. SWALWELL:	And could you set the scene for us?	Is this in
23 a common space?	Your office?	His office?	Where was the
24 conversation?
25 MR. SANDY:	As I recall, it	was in a hallway after a meeting where

UNCLASSIFIED

33
UNCLASSIFIED


1 we had an initial conversation, but the specific request was
2 communicated to me via phone later on the 19th.	So I was in my office,
3 and I presume he was in his.
4 MR. SWALWELL:	Okay.	And you received a phone call from
5 Mr. Duffey to you in your office.
6 MR. SANDY:	He sent me an email saying we needed to connect.	I
7 probably called him.
8 MR. SWALWELL:	And, in the email, did he reference what you needed
9 to connect about, or did he just say he wanted to connect?

10 MR. SANDY:	As I recall, it was about Ukraine.
11 MR. SWALWELL:	Okay.

12 Mr. Mitchell?
13 BY MR. MITCHELL:
14 Q	But it sounds like you had a subsequent conversation with
15 him on the 19th.	Is that right?
16 A	So that was the conversation I was describing with the
17 specific request.
18 Q	All right.	And you indicated that Mr. Duffey said he wanted
19 to create an apportionment that would implement the hold.	Can you
20 describe the conversation surrounding how to create this apportionment
21 or what that apportionment might look like with Mr. Duffey on that day?
22 A	Right.	So, o,n that day, I emphasized that that would raise
23 a number of questions that we would need to address.	And so I advised
24 that we would want to consult with our Office of the General Counsel
25 on those questions first.

UNCLASSIFIED

.. . .



34
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	When you were speaking with Mr. Duffey, putting aside any
2 subsequent conversation you might have had with legal counsel, what
3 were those questions that you raised with him?


4

5 Act

A	I just made a general reference to the Impoundment Control


6 Q	Okay.
7 A	- - and said that we would have to assess that with the advice

8 of counsel before proceeding.
9 Q	Okay.	And you're not an attorney, correct?

10 A	That is correct.
11 Q	What is your training with -- your professional training

12 with regard to accounting, for example?
13 A	Well, I would say, all career staff who work in these resource
14 management offices generally have general awareness of, for example,
15 in this case, the Impoundment Control Act --

16 Q	Okay.
17 A	-- enough knowledge to know when to ask for advice.
18 Q	Okay.	So, in these specific circumstances --
19 A	Yes.
20 Q	-- when you raised the Impoundment Control Act with

21 Mr. Duffey during this conversation on July 19th, why did you think
22 that a modification to the apportionment to account for the hold might
23 implicate the Impoundment Control Act?
24 A	Ah.	Because these moneys are what we call 1-year funds,
25 which means that their period of availability was expiring on September

UNCLASSIFIED

35
UNCLASSIFIED


1 30th.	And consistent with a layman's understanding of the Impoundment
2 Control Act, we need to ensure that agencies are able to obligate funds
3 before they expire.
4 Q	And what is your understanding of, if those funds cannot be
5 obligated before they expire, what happens?
6 A	Then  they  basically expire  and  they  return  to the Treasury.
7 Q	And  there  could   be  a  violation   of   the   Impoundment  Control
8 Act if	they expire in that way?
9 A	Potentially.
10 Q	Okay.	And that was your concern July 19th when you had this
11 conversation with Mr. Duffey?
12 A	My concern was that there was - - I asked about the duration
13 of  the  hold and was told there was not  clear guidance on that.	So that's
14 what prompted my concern.
15 Q	Okay.	So you asked Mr. Duffey about the duration of the
16 hold.


17 A

18 Q

That is	correct.
Okay.	What was Mr. Duffey' s reaction when you mentioned the


19 Impoundment Control Act?
20 A	I think he appreciated my concern and acknowledged that I
21 offered to take the lead in terms of following up with the Office of
22 General Counsel.


23 Q

24 A

Okay.	So did he direct  you  to  consult  with General Counsel? I was doing that in my own initiative, but he certainly didn't

25 object.


UNCLASSIFIED

36
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Q	Okay.
2 Now, Mr. Duffey, you indicated, was a political appointee.	Is

3 that correct?

4 A	Yes, he is.
5 Q	Do you have general understanding of Mr. Duffey's

6 familiarity with apportionments and the Impoundment Control Act at the
7 time that you had this conversation on July 19th?

8 A	I was not aware of any previous experience of his.
9 Q	All right.	Just to be clear, are you saying that you don't

10 believe that he had any prior experience on July 19th regarding the
11 Impoundment Control Act or apportionments generally?


12 A

13 Q

I was not aware of any prior experience that he had. Okay.

14 This conversation that you had with Mr. Duffey, did you document
15 it in any way?

16ANo.17QOkay.Did you have any followup emails or any sort of18 memoranda that would reflect the fact of the conversation on July 19th
19 with Mr. Duffey?
20 A	No.	I followed up by phone with the Office of General
21 Counsel.
22 Q	Okay.	What about in a calendar?	Is there any sort of
23 calendar record of this meeting on July 19th?
24 A	No.
25 MR. SWALWELL:	What day did you follow up by phone with General

UNCLASSIFIED

37
UNCLASSIFIED


1 Counsel?
2 MR. SANDY:	I followed up with an initial conversation that
3 evening and then scheduled a subsequent call for Monday morning, the 4		22nd.
5 MR. SWALWELL:	So July 19, in the evening, by phone, you contact
6 General Counsel.

7 MR. SANDY:	Correct.
8 MR. SWALWELL:	Okay.
9 BY MR. MITCHELL:
10 Q	You indicated, when you got back from leave, I think you said
11 you received an email from Mr. Duffey saying, "Call me."	Is that
12 right?


13 A

14 Q

Yes.
Okay.	Do you know whether anyone told Mr. Duffey to talk


15 to you about the hold?
16 A	So he shared with me an email that described the desire - - the
17 President's direction with respect to the hold.


18

19	you?
20

21

22

23

24

25

Q	How did he share this email with you?	Did he forward it to


A	Yes, he did.
Q	What was the date of that email?
A	As I recall, the date of the email was July 12th.
Q	While you were on leave?
A	Correct.
Q	And who was that email from?

Office of the Chief of Staff. Which Chief of Staff?
Oh.	Chief of Staff of the White House, that office. So Mick Mulvaney's office?
Correct.
And who from the Office of Chief of Staff sent this email? Mr. Robert Blair.
Who is Robert Blair?
He is a senior advisor to the Acting Chief of Staff.
Have you ever had any interactions with Mr. Blair during the


11 course of your duties?
12 A	Yes.	Previously, he was the Associate Director for National
13 Security Programs -- in essence, Mike Duffey's predecessor.
14 Q	Okay.	So he was your immediate supervisor for some period
15 of time at OMB?


16 A

17 Q

Correct.
And then did Mr. Blair go to the Office of Chief of Staff


18 more or less when Mr. Mulvaney went from 0MB to Office of Chief of Staff?
19 A	Shortly thereafter, as I recall.
20 Q	And Mr. Mulvaney was also, during this time period, the
21 Acting Director of 0MB, correct?	He was dual-hatted?	Let me be
22 precise about my time period.	In mid-July of 2019.
23 A	So he retains the title of Director of 0MB, but he does not
24 perform those functions.
25 Q	Okay.

UNCLASSIFIED




39
UNCLASSIFIED


1 So this July 12th email from Mr. Blair, what did it say?
2 A	To the best of my recollection, that the President is

1 Q	Did he indicate that he was going to try to get more
2 information as to why the President was placing a hold on security
3 assistance?
4 A	I am pausing because I -- there was certainly a desire to
5 learn more about the rationale.
6 Q	Whose desire?
7 A	A desire on the part of Mike Duffey, myself, and other people

8 working on this issue.	So I want to answer your question accurately
9 in terms of saying, that desire was acknowledged.
10 Q	All right.	Did Mr. Duffey say that he was going to try to
11 get additional information as to the reason for the hold?
12 A	Yes.	He certainly said that if he got additional
13 information he would share it with us.
14 Q	Okay.	At any point in time, from the moment that you walked
15 into the SCIF to anytime in history, has Mr. Duffey ever provided to
16 you a reason why the President wanted to place a hold on security
17 assistance?
18 A	I recall in early September an email that attributed the hold
19 to the President's concern about other countries not contributing more
20 to Ukraine.
21 Q	What was the date of this email?	You said early September.

2 BY MR. MITCHELL:
3 Q	Was this the first time that you heard that the hold might
4 be about some sort of concern that other countries are not providing
5 sufficient support to Ukraine?
6 A	We had received information requesting -- sorry.	We had
7 received requests for additional information on what other countries
8 were contributing to Ukraine.
9 Q	Okay.	Did you have any other conversations with Mr. Duffey
10 following this email in early September about this email or about the
11 fact


12 A

13 Q

May I consult with counsel?
Sure.	Let me finish the question, though.	Or about the


14 substance of the email, the fact of the other countries not providing
15 sufficient assistance?
16 [Discussion off the record?]
17 MR. SANDY:	I just want to clarify, I do recall in early September
18 that we got requests for information on what additional countries were
19 contributing to Ukraine.	I would want to be accurate in recollecting
20 the precise date of the email, so I'd like to amend my previous comment
21 and say, I just don't want to provide something false, because I don't
22 remember the specific date.
23 BY MR. MITCHELL:
24 Q	Okay.	So it may have been before or it may have been after
25 the 9th of September.	You just recall that it was the beginning of

UNCLASSIFIED











so
UNCLASSIFIED


1 A	Correct.
2 Q	And did you get that advice?	Not asking you what the advice
3 was, but did OGC provide you with guidance?

4	A	[Nonverbal response.]
5	Q	And when did they do that?
6	A	So those conversations lasted over several days.
7 Q	Okay.
8 A	And the answer to your question is yes.
9 Q	Okay.	And was the guidance -- not asking about the content

10 of the guidance, but did it	come over email?	Was it	an official letter?
11 And when did it arrive, finally?
12 A	There were email exchanges, and I recall an email that
13 concluded those exchanges on Wednesday, July 24th.
14 Q	Okay.	And I believe you indicated the question was relating
15 to the Impoundment Control Act.
16 A	My questions, yes.
17 Q	Right.	Okay.	And the issue is resolved on Wednesday, July
18 24th.	And, obviously, because of what happened, the hold was
19 implemented.	Is that correct?
20 A	The issues addressed questions that I had vis-a-vis an
21 apportionment.
22 Q	Right.


23 A

24 Q

And so Uh-huh.

I just want to answer your question precisely.

25 A

So that apportionment was finalized on July 25th.

1 A	Chiefly through Mike Duffey -
2 Q	Okay.
3 A	-- but also in the interagency processes of the National

4 Security Council.
5 Q	Okay.	And did you get additional guidance?
6 And just to be clear, the footnote restricting the obligations,
7 how long is that in effect for?	Is that a 2-week hold?
8 A	It was through August 5th, as I recall.
9 Q	Okay.
10 [Discussion off the record.]
11 BY MR. CASTOR:
12 Q	So the first written apportionment with the footnote
13 restricting the funds goes out on July 25th.
14 A	Yes, sir.
15 Q	And that's holding the funds, in effect, until August 5th;
16 that's the next date?


17 A

18 Q

Correct.
Okay.	And during that time period, you said you were seeking


19 guidance from policy officials, and you mentioned DOD and the National
20 Security Council?


21 A
22 Q

23 A

Through the National Security Council process. Okay.
Yes.


24 Q	And what can you tell us about those communications?	Like,
25 who were you dealing with at the NSC?

UNCLASSIFIED











59
UNCLASSIFIED


1 there had been a subsequent apportionment.
2 Q	When was the subsequent apportionment?	That was on August
3 5th, you said?
4 A	It would've come shortly after the first one, which expired
5 on August 5th.	So I believe it was on August 5th.

6 Q	How long was the memo?	Do you remember?
7 A	Oh, maybe three or four pages with content from those

8 different contributing components.
9 Q	Okay.	Three or four pages, and each of the three components
10 had a piece to the memo?


11 A

12 Q

That's correct.
Okay.	And for your piece, do you remember anything more


13 about it?


14 A

15 Q

16 A

I do remember that we provided our recommendation. Okay.	And what was the recommendation?
The recommendation was to


17 [Discussion off the record.]
18 MR. SANDY:	The recommendation was to remove the hold -
19 MR. CASTOR:	Okay.
20 MR. SANDY:	-- on certain policy arguments.
21 BY MR. CASTOR:

22 Q

23 A

Okay.	Do you remember what the policy arguments were? One was that the assistance to Ukraine is consistent with

24 the national security strategy - -
